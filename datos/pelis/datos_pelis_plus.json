            "reviewBody": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn&apos;t like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando&apos;s ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.\n\nTo make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don&apos;s children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they&apos;re put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.\n\n2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character&apos;s character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).\n\n3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn&apos;t to make films as short as possible.\n\nAll the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn&apos;t mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.\n\nI feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.",

            "reviewBody": "Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can&apos;t possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what&apos;s basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) &quot;in the role&quot; of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn&apos;t so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone&apos;s mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the &quot;inside&quot; was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn&apos;t convey Michael&apos;s underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren&apos;t well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended &quot;flashback&quot; segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that&apos;s a bit of my bias creeping in, as I&apos;m a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let&apos;s talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we&apos;re toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere&apos;s also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I&apos;d now call &quot;J.K. Rowling Syndrome&quot;. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d\u00e9nouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI&apos;ve barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn&apos;t a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can&apos;t remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film&apos;s importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.",

Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass\n\n*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again\n\n*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene",

            "reviewBody": "This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said &quot;Its the bees&apos; knees&quot;. The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.\n\nThe tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.\n\nThe audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda&apos;s character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.\n\nOn top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.\n\nI started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.\n\nHow a film should be made.  Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10",

I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler&apos;s List&quot;. The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; is a three hour film that feels too short."

            "reviewBody": "All the threads of Tolkien&apos;s magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson&apos;s adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\n\n&quot;Return of the King&quot; is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.\n\nThe cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien&apos;s creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.\n\nNow that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien&apos;s huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien&apos;s source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien&apos;s myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...",

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60&apos;s pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre&apos;s. I mean, I would agree that most western&apos;s are pretty much the same and stereotypical.\n\nSergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it&apos;s characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let&apos;s give it up for Sergio! \n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I&apos;d never read any of Tolkien&apos;s books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I&apos;ve read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.\n\nI loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don&apos;t want to leave. I&apos;ve never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the &quot;good&quot; characters, but also with the &quot;evil&quot; ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can&apos;t imagine the movie without him.\n\nSome films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan&apos;s Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.\n\nBut after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien&apos;s beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won&apos;t be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.\n\nIt is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.\n\nThe LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",

He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.\n\nOnly in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam&apos;s war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero. \n\nGary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.\n\nAll in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful."

At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they&apos;re played with love, respect and meaning.\n\nThough the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum&apos;s (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn&apos;t help believe he was real! Though &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li&apos;l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF &quot;cast&quot; lacked.\n\nAs a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would&apos;ve worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!"

            "reviewBody": "Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.\n\nThe plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.\n\nWhat makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill&apos;s interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. \n\nTechnically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. \n\nEditing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky&apos;s photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. \n\nILM&apos;s visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. \n\nAgain, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on\u2013set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt&apos;s sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.\n\nHowever, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. \n\nCongratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."

Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.\n\nIf we say it sci-fi at its best, it won&apos;t be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it&apos;s understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.\n\nA salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.",

We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It&apos;s a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like.

            "reviewBody": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the &quot;mental illness&quot; card to get out of prison time, thinking it&apos;ll be a piece of cake, but he&apos;s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy&apos;s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\n\n&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; (1975) is a film you&apos;ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn&apos;t &apos;get&apos; a lot of the insights the film conveys.\n\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their &quot;therapy&quot; is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer&apos;s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be &quot;dealt with.&quot;\n\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched &quot;isn&apos;t that bad&quot; or that &quot;she was only trying to do her job&quot;, etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film&apos;s brilliance: Ratched&apos;s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she&apos;s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\n\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway&apos;s portrayal of Joan Crawford in &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn&apos;t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\n\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he&apos;s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\n\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That&apos;s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that &quot;appearances&quot; are not about inward reality and, worse, &quot;the letter kills.&quot;\n\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you&apos;ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren&apos;t any good people in such institutions, of course).\n\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of &quot;Chief&quot; Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A",

            "reviewBody": "This is my favorite Kurosawa film, the man was a true master of the cinematic arts.  If you have never seen a Kurosawa film definetly make this your first.  Though extremely long at about 3 1/2 hours it is well worth the time spent.\n\nTo quickly summarize, a poor Japanese village hires 7 Samurai to protect it from being raided by bandits.  Don&apos;t get me wrong there is way more to it than that, I just dont want to give anything away.  This is an intense and emotional movie that hooks you from the first scene and keeps you on the line till it is all over.  The battle scene at the end is in true Kurosawa form.  The acting is outstanding by everyone involved from the main characters all the way down to the very last extra.  Of course the best way to see any film, especially a Kurosawa film is on the big screen if you are able to.  Beautifully filmed, in black and white, anyone familiar with Kurosawa&apos;s work has to wonder visually how much more gorgeous it could have been had Kurosawa had the option of color in 1954.\n\nThe camera use is brilliant and every scene is balanced visually.  This film is also the first one to use &quot;the wipe&quot; as a way of changing from one scene to another.  This technique was later used by George Lucas in his Star Wars movies.  I would also recommend the DVD version that has the commentary option by the Japanese cinema expert if anyone is interested in a deeper understanding of the &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whys&quot; of Kurosawa&apos;s film making.  Any man, woman, boy or girl who just wants to see a really, really great movie, THIS IS THE ONE!  An A+++ in my book."

The great cinematography knows when to pull the camera back, as well as to draw it close for great effect. 6. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together. 7. The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema. 8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them? 9. Despite the underdeveloped character of Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), the conclusion is still one of the hardest hitting and iconic endings ever created.\n\nCons: 1. Tracy is a severely underdeveloped character, with her pregnancy-confessing scene to Somerset feeling lazily forced to add weight to the final scene.",

            "reviewBody": "I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an \u00ab UGC culte \u00bb evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.\n\nWithout unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman&apos;s private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.\n\nAs a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10",

            "reviewBody": "Roberto Benigni&apos;s Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin&apos;s Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former&apos;s is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).\n\nIt is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.\n\nGuido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso&apos;s case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido&apos;s translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.\n\nThe emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.\n\nThis is certainly no Schindler&apos;s List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film&apos;s favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.\n\nBenigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven&apos;s Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.\n\nPlease don&apos;t let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.\n\nPlease see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I&apos;m sure that you will not be disappointed.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always thought that the reason It&apos;s A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.\n\nGeorge Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He&apos;s got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he&apos;s got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the &quot;richest and meanest man in town&quot;, embodied in Lionel Barrymore.\n\nIt&apos;s a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn&apos;t hurt him.\n\nRemember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.\n\nBut before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he&apos;s given the story of George Bailey&apos;s life. And we see the kind of struggles he&apos;s had, the sacrifices he&apos;s made for the good of a whole lot of others. We&apos;ve also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. \n\nSomething happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It&apos;s driven him to the brink of despair. That&apos;s why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It&apos;s something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.\n\nBut I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven&apos;t contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It&apos;s a simple, but profound lesson.\n\nWhat if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It&apos;s an interesting point of speculation.\n\nIn addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.\n\nDonna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.\n\nWhen Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he&apos;s saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. \n\nAnd that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It&apos;s A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot;\n\nPre review:\n\nIts writing started in January 1973, &quot;eight hours a day, five days a week&quot;, George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThen, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was &quot;too strange&quot;.\n\nSuddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas&apos; genius. And that&apos;s how Star Wars became a reality.\n\nThe shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn&apos;t stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...\n\nReview:\n\nStar Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...\n\nOne of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick&apos;s revolutionary masterpiece: &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.\n\nThe story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer&apos;s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel &quot;in distress&quot;, a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.\n\nThe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.\n\nThe visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic &quot;filtered look&quot; so he kept changing key lights for a &quot;flashing&quot; effect. He used a loose, &quot;nervous&quot; frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.&quot; This is authenticity is reflected in it&apos;s most iconic shot: the &apos;Binary Sunset&apos; sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke&apos;s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.\n\nBooks such as &quot;The hero with a thousand faces&quot; by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa&apos;s storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang&apos;s it&apos;s iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it&apos;s soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.\n\n10/10",

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It&apos;s just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It&apos;s not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it&apos;s the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it&apos;s heading (no pun intended), but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that it&apos;s beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.\n\nGoing out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It&apos;s the best possible way this could go, even if it&apos;s not in our grasps just yet ...",

After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don&apos;t.\n\nNo one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that `Spirited Away&apos; might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.   The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there&apos;s a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?    The rules of this world don&apos;t seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it&apos;s all supposed to be about.\n\nI don&apos;t want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that `Spirited Away&apos; has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well. \n\n `Spirited Away&apos; offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care."

I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn&apos;t see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn&apos;t compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn&apos;t a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."

Parasite is one of them. If this isn&apos;t a masterpiece, then I don&apos;t know what is.\n\nI&apos;m going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn&apos;t know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.\n\nWhat I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I&apos;ve seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I&apos;m honestly not sure if I&apos;ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).\n\nAnd it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.\n\nI&apos;m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I&apos;ve seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it&apos;s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It&apos;s extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there&apos;s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie&apos;s over (and this one&apos;s not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).\n\nCatch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one&apos;s), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.\n\nWhen it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.",

            "reviewBody": "Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one&apos;s beliefs.\n\nEvery frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film&apos;s technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa&apos;s samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa&apos;s work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being &quot;a facade&quot; to directly quote the film.\n\nI say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them.

            "reviewBody": "And yes, I&apos;d consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.\n\nThe story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger&apos;s request) and he&apos;s up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don&apos;t seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.\n\nNot all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don&apos;t need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.\n\nI could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don&apos;t have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it&apos;s good enough, they&apos;ll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately, the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.\n\nThe Hound.",

This generation&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv&apos;s &quot;Family Ties&quot;, casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."

            "reviewBody": "Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.\n\nThe Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa&apos;s brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can&apos;t. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn&apos;t do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.\n\nThe Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn&apos;t need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.\n\nThe music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer&apos;s music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.\n\nI really like James Earl Jones (he&apos;s pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn&apos;t want to do this role, but he couldn&apos;t contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn&apos;t have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can&apos;t help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!\n\nBe warned, The Lion King isn&apos;t really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don&apos;t deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.\n\nThis is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don&apos;t say `haha, he&apos;s dead&apos;, you say `Gasp! I&apos;m so sad!&apos; If it weren&apos;t for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.\n\nThe Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.\n\nMy rating: 9/10\n\nRated G for intense thematic elements.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can&apos;t watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro&apos;s star-making job in &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot;.  5 stars out of 5."

It is a sensational performance - for which he didn&apos;t even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you&apos;ll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma&apos;s boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot; to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in &quot;American Psycho&quot;. Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son&apos;s trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",

A timeless classic that is perfectly geared, engaged and enmeshed for the unstoppable onslaught of technology and its perpetual modernisation - happiness beckons.",

Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it&apos;s strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).\n\nI strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I&apos;ve seen, anime or not.",

I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn&apos;t mean you can play God and try to make things &quot;your way&quot; and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full.",

Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film, he dominated every moment he was on the screen. Was he a likable guy? No way..but he was mesmerizing. Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film. It&apos;s among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega-million dollar special effects--it just had terrific acting, writing and direction. See this film and see how a quality film is crafted. &apos;Nuff said...",

People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist&apos;s dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you&apos;re looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction."

The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk (Harry Myers) and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he loves.\n\nChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made. Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but I&apos;d also argue that it&apos;s one of the greatest love stories, if not the greatest. It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and there&apos;s really not a weak spot to be found here. Being 1931 it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound. He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point. The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point. \n\nThe scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success. The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water. In fact, the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own. Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film. What&apos;s so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really delivers.\n\nChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here. Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you can&apos;t help but be impressed with the actor. Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together. Then you&apos;ve got Cherrill who wasn&apos;t a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughout.\n\nCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history. There&apos;s really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year."

            "reviewBody": "It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don&apos;t over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors &amp; countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored. \n\nIntouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as na\u00efve as it may sound, the universality of humanity. \n\nThe story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. \n\nThe audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe&apos;s life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. \n\nAgain, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc. \n\nThe audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. \n\nOn paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It&apos;s approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of &quot;best movie of the year&quot;. \n\nI cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. \n\nPS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way &quot;The Departed&quot; did for &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;.",

            "reviewBody": "Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn&apos;t familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn&apos;t seen it?\n\nI&apos;ve been watching &apos;Casablanca&apos; over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.\n\nBut what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of &apos;Casablanca&apos; first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (&quot;This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!&quot;) or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (&quot;What watch?&quot;).\n\nBut &apos;Casablanca&apos; is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than &apos;Casablanca&apos;? &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos; is on my mind here, and &apos;All About Eve&apos; and &apos;Sunset Blvd.&apos; come close, too, but still I think &apos;Casablanca&apos; tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it&apos;s unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (&quot;I was misinformed.&quot;) and Claude Rains (&quot;I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here&quot;). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of &apos;Die Wacht am Rhein&apos; and &apos;La Marseillaise&apos; is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin&apos;s &apos;The Great Dictator&apos;), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who&apos;ve never seen &apos;Casablanca&apos;. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn&apos;t have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?\n\nAbout the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart&apos;s and Ingrid Bergman&apos;s chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains&apos; terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I&apos;d love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in &apos;Schindler&apos;s List&apos;. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick&apos;s Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he&apos;s a joy whenever he&apos;s on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (&quot;Vultures everywhere!&quot;) accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the &quot;What watch&quot;-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, &quot;being a German, he would have taken it anyway&quot;. His performance is simply criminally overlooked.\n\nSo is there a weakest link in &apos;Casablanca&apos;? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in &apos;Casablanca&apos;, too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn&apos;t come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I&apos;m almost ashamed that I&apos;m so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.\n\nSo whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we&apos;re desperate to see a great film: We&apos;ll always have Casablanca!",

            "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray &apos;Americanism&apos;, the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as &apos;Frontier country&apos; where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.\n\nAnd then came this film. The title, &apos;Once Upon A Time In The West&apos; must have seemed to mean nothing more than &apos;just another western&apos; to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a &apos;generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian&apos; and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.\n\nI cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it&apos;s genre?\n\nAnother great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn&apos;t required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.\n\nAll in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like &apos;A Fistful of Dynamite&apos;, &apos;The Good The Bad and The Ugly&apos;, and &apos;For a Few Dollars More&apos;, none could equal &apos;Once Upon A Time In The West&apos; in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....\n\nI only wish I&apos;d have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).\n\nA tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can&apos;t find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........\n\nI (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can&apos;t find anything less than perfect about it.",

            "reviewBody": "Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it&apos;s one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can&apos;t imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD&apos;s documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart&apos;s neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart&apos;s reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (&quot;Miss Torso&quot;), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.",

Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen.",

            "reviewBody": "&apos;Alien&apos; is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, &quot;lived-in&quot; look of space-freighter Nostromo&apos;s interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) &quot;retro&quot; technology inside the ship doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it&apos;s the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). \n\nI feel it&apos;s especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and &apos;Alien&apos; simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It&apos;s a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn&apos;t just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it&apos;s a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10. \n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",

There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn&apos;t work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors&apos; performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.\n\nOriginal films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn&apos;t caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.\n\nAs I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn&apos;t a cheap trick to make the movie more &quot;intelectual&quot;, it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn&apos;t be missed.",

            "reviewBody": "It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o&apos;clock shadow looking like it&apos;s closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!\n\nWhhhoooooo!! I&apos;m left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.\n\nIndiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today&apos;s terms.\n\nRaiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy&apos;s battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. &quot; Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. &quot; ( a battered and bloody Indy ) &quot; Truck? What truck?&quot; ( and then later ) &quot;Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar&apos;s. I&apos;m going after that truck. &quot;\n\nSola ) &quot; How? &quot; ( Indy ) I don&apos;t know I&apos;m making this up as I go.&quot;\n\nRaiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven&apos;t seen this movie in a while or if you haven&apos;t seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.\n\nTRUST ME",

            "reviewBody": "This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin&apos;s satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin&apos;s first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber&apos;s chair , among them .\n\nProduction on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin&apos;s biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time.",

            "reviewBody": "(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern &amp; Samuel L. Jackson)\n\nSet in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he&apos;s heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.\n\nFor a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn&apos;t feel that way as the film is so action packed that it&apos;ll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I&apos;ll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece.",

That was until I saw The Lives of Others.\n\nPutting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn&apos;t know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.\n\nAs a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.\n\nIn summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you&apos;ll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You&apos;ll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.\n\n10 out of 10 is too modest.",

            "name": "KUBRICK&apos;S GENUINE CLASSIC MASTERPIECE",
            "reviewBody": "What to say that hasn&apos;t already been said. This astonishing cinematic work of art (no kidding) unquestionably is the GREATEST FILM EVER - bar none.  I deeply and passionately LOVE this brilliant early Kubrick production. Congratulations to expert screenwriters (and unique pulp writers of the 5O&apos;s) Calder Willingham (who also penned his own excellent adaptation of &quot;The Strange One&quot;; highly recommended) and Jim Thompson (&quot;The Grifters&quot; &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;; which strongly influenced Tarantino), who both present a superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true.  If only we had more real writers and scripts like this remarkable achievement, we&apos;d be writing far more favorable reviews. &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, alone, would serve as anyone&apos;s lifetime achievement award.\n\n I don&apos;t care how much you HATE B&amp;W films - put this one on your MUST-SEE. Compelling cinema-verite photography creates astounding visuals from a varity of incisive angles; like the famous mobile wide-angle tracking shot of Dax (probably Kirk Douglas&apos;s most stirring and important performance) moving through the squalid and horrifying trenches as the battle begins with explosions breaking out all over.  The suspense and tension is frightening, but almost beautifully eerie in the most compelling ways as Kubrick takes us through the deadly limbo of no-man&apos;s land - the &apos;paths of glory&apos; which finally leads to the grave.  The action, skillfully combined with powerful moral and existential themes are amazingly conveyed through the bleak yet articulately stunning visuals.  THIS IS A FILMMAKER&apos;S FILM!\n\n The moral outrage of the sadistic injustice of the military courtmartial never fails to make my blood fully boil.  The hypocrisy and corruption is degradingly infuriating.  If anything will make a cynic out of you, it&apos;s this appropriately pessimistic and depressing cinema chronical based on a true stupid incident in WWI.  What&apos;s even worse is how POG, in many perceptive ways, serves as an allegory for all the B.S. in real life: Pig-headed leadership in the parasitic hands of the superior greed freaks, two-faced deceptive manipulations, double-standards, backstabbings, social bigotry, arm-chair warriors, egotism, corrupt politics, the militaries&apos;s abuse of too much power - and it&apos;s destructive desire at satisfying it&apos;s lust for vainglory (sounds a little like Hollywood) - Did I leave anything out?  You name it, POG has it - and I&apos;m not being sarcastic.\n\n The entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention to George Macready as the utterly pompous power-mad glory-seeking &quot;soldier&quot;, General Mireuo (who thinks nothing about ordering his troops to open fire on his own men for not charging out of the trenches and dying for his &quot;country&quot;; which smells a bit like ME ME ME).  Don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll throughly hate his guts. It truly is true method acting.  Again, kudos to Macready,  a fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians. (Incidently, this was a favorite film of a young 195O&apos;s Marlon Brando and old salty Winston Churchill, who praised Kubrick&apos;s incisive authenticity in the exciting battle scene, which does resemble news footage).\n\n Timothy Carey (also ultra-offbeat-cool in Kubrick&apos;s other exceptional early flick, &quot;The Killing&quot;) is morbidly humorous and gut-wrenching as one of the poor fools coldly picked to be executed; all in the ruthless &apos;patriotic&apos; name (and amoral game) of &apos;glory&apos;. ARE ANY OF OUR LEADERS LISTENING?  Too bad that Carey&apos;s memorable talents were so underused by Hollywood, but that always seems to be the unfortunate norm.  A little like what ironically happens to him in this intriguing but downbeat story.\n\n Ralph Meeker (who was also memorable as the brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer in the 5O&apos;s cult gem &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; - a complete opposite role that shows a true range of his acting abilities) delivers another wretching performance as the true brave soldier unjustly sentenced for &quot;Cowardice in the Face of the Enemy&quot;.  (Maybe he should have turned &apos;about face&apos;, but it would have still been &apos;damned if he did and damned if he didn&apos;t&apos; - another grim moral theme here).  His breakdown scene right before he is to be taken out and shot is terribly heartbreaking, for I felt so wanting, but helplessly unable, to come to his help.\n\n Take my word for it, everyone else is awesome; a true actor&apos;s dramatic show with dark satirical overtones.  POG goes beyond the mere preaching anti-war diatribe (though it does convey that almost naturally, like going without having to say).  It&apos;s a great classic morality play that will really make you stop (many, many times) and truly make you think (many many times). Airheads not allowed.  Moreover, this haunting and disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment, something too many art films aren&apos;t.     &gt;\n\n It will really make you question things about our troubled, convoluted world and how things are to often immorally and inhumanly run all in the sick name of greed and destructive power. Not too lovely, for the director pulls no punches.  This film really has grown more profound (and currently pertinent) since its initial release.  Also the editing is taut and concise; there isn&apos;t a single wasted moment.  Count the number of films on one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat; that most critics and user commentators are always rightfully harking on.  I&apos;ll shut up now.  Go see this one-of-a-kind film, then see it again - and again, etc.  &gt;"

It&apos;s interesting to watch the film during different times in one&apos;s life \u0096 when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20&apos;s and early 30&apos;s I found it to have a different impact on me \u0096 I was saddened by Desmond&apos;s mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she&apos;s happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I&apos;ve seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated&apos; themes in this film \u0096 the circle of life that is Hollywood isn&apos;t going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven&apos;t seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.\n\n--Shelly",

Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.\n\nAt least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.\n\nThe movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.\n\nAll in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.",

            "reviewBody": "Updated review 4-9-19\n\nI&apos;ve now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn&apos;t for everyone. Let&apos;s break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.\n\nIf we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they&apos;re great.\n\nThe story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.\n\nThe voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.\n\nShamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I&apos;ve watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.\n\nChris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.\n\nI never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I&apos;m working or doing something else and I&apos;ll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.\n\nI&apos;ve always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.\n\nThe greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. &quot;The most visually stunning movie I&apos;ve ever seen&quot;. Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn&apos;t use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they&apos;re seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it&apos;s just simply too much for some people. I get that.\n\nAs far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren&apos;t many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.\n\nOriginal review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.\n\nWhat is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton&apos;s dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they&apos;re all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that &apos;feel the most like a comic book&apos;, you&apos;d probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.\n\nBut they aren&apos;t literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really &apos;just cartoons&apos;, and I don&apos;t mean that in a bad way. They&apos;re simply cartoon versions of comic books.\n\nSpider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It&apos;s an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.\n\nThis movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I&apos;m-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.\n\nRemember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like &quot;oh wow! It&apos;s a comic book come to life!&quot;? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.\n\nBut here&apos;s the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a &quot;here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!&quot;\n\nMy first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I&apos;ve built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I&apos;ve gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It&apos;s that great.",

            "reviewBody": "Yours truly has never been much of a reader, though with one notable exception: the work of Agatha Christie. I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There&apos;s one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie&apos;s whodunits, of course, namely that you can&apos;t experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie&apos;s biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder&apos;s surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there&apos;s also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Devil&apos;s Advocate&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;\u0085) were clearly influenced by &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;. In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn&apos;t find 100% plausible.",

            "reviewBody": "Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK&apos;s Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80&apos;s- performs it&apos;s duty as a fright flick, and then some.\n\nThere are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that&apos;s completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it&apos;s memorable conclusion in the last half hour.\n\nKudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of &apos;Hollywood talk&apos;, which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak &apos;on the nose&apos;, and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as &apos;Wendy&apos; gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let&apos;s face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That&apos;s what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast."

This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn&apos;t this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don&apos;t think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I&apos;ve seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy.

            "reviewBody": "Studio Ghibli has been Japan&apos;s leading anime Production Company since the 1980&apos;s, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film &quot;Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind&quot; (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.\n\nThe film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Y\u00f4ji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe&apos;s wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Y\u00fbko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka&apos;s efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side&apos;s bid for allegiance.\n\n&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki&apos;s best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, &quot;Mononoke&quot; has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters&apos; nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli&apos;s other works, which were aimed mostly at children.\n\nOf course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film&apos;s wonder, because Miyazaki&apos;s true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi&apos;s music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.\n\nOverwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg&apos;s &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; became Japan&apos;s No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",

            "reviewBody": "The first time I watched &quot;Old-boy&quot;, I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn&apos;t quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it&apos;s one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography &amp; scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.\n\n2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and &quot;Old-boy&quot;, and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.\n\nKnowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.\n\nDon&apos;t be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don&apos;t be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It&apos;s worth it.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie shows that despite failure, despite your fears, despite your enemies, you can be a hero. you can use all three of those things to your advantage and become something better than you were before you encountered them. it masterfully shows and tells that ANYONE can be a hero.\n\nobviously on a technical level this film is perfect. almost the entirety of the third act is shot in beautiful imax, that&apos;s sadly only in 16:9 on 4K. just like with the previous transfers, sound and picture are great, but this is probably the best looking film to me.\n\nit may not seem like it at first, but just like ra&apos;s and joker, bane is the opposite side of the same coin for batman. tom hardy perfectly embodies bane and the darkness, and obviously he&apos;s a downgrade from joker, but that doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s not the perfect villain for a finale.\n\nhans zimmer delivers probably my third favorite score from him, with an incredible theme for bane as well as many extensions of previous themes.\n\nthis is such an underrated finale. all three films mesh together so well, they feel like one. they mean so much to me, and i&apos;ll forever thank nolan for making these films.",

            "reviewBody": "There are really good movies and then there&apos;s that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn&apos;t think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I&apos;ve seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.\n\nSigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.\n\nPaul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.\n\nPaxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can&apos;t hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won&apos;t be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is &quot; Hey man, we&apos;re not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they&apos;re going to get us and..... &quot; ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training. &quot; ( Hudson ) &quot; Why don&apos;t ya put her in charge!!! &quot;\n\nPaxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven&apos;t seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can&apos;t go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made.  If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood, then Cameron is his heir apparent.  Oh, and one more thing, Paxton will win an Oscar one day.",

            "reviewBody": "Many people compare &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; with &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In my opinion these two movies can&apos;t be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don&apos;t compare a Picasso to Michelangelo&apos;s Sixteen Chapel either, do you?\n\nWhat is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He&apos;s one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. \n\nThe way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don&apos;t think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn&apos;t want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910&apos;s - 1930&apos;s - 1960&apos;s), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director&apos;s cut. \n\nThe second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn&apos;t said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.\n\nLast but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn&apos;t left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.\n\nI can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn&apos;t a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You&apos;ll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you&apos;ll find this one of the best movies you&apos;ve ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",

It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.\n\nI laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a &quot;go on!&quot; during one scene\n\nI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.\n\nMade by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.\n\nGo with it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nSoak up every second, it doesn&apos;t feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.\n\nI have nothing else to say.\n\n10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!\n\nFans! Assemble!",

Directed by Nadine Labaki and written by Labaki, Joelle Keserwani, Jihad Hojeily and Georges Khabbaz the movie follows the journey and the misery of a boy called Zain that led him to sue his parents for giving him life!  The movie took years to finish with a total of 500 hours of rushes filmed! Shot in a &quot;Cinema Realit\u00e9&quot; style without any professional actors and with a raw cinematography you&apos;re going to witness the dark side of the country, the unacceptable neighborhoods, the unfair life that poor children are facing.  Everyone is absolutely well casted! Zain was the ultimate discovery a super talented boy, the Ethiopian maid was great also and even the real retired judge did a good job. Each actor is really telling his own personal story so you will arrive at a point where you couldn&apos;t differentiate if you&apos;re watching cinema, a written script or even a documentary. Wonderful job from Labaki and well deserved Jury Prize at Cannes!  Thumbs up also to Khaled Mouzanar for giving us another remarkable score. The movie is nothing less than heartbreaking.  As Truffaut freezed his last scene back in 1959 in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; giving us some hope, the last shot of Capernaum will speak a lot...!",

            "reviewBody": "Das Boot is not just a great war film: it&apos;s a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.\n\nI saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my &quot;depressing movie festival.&quot; (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend &quot;entries.&quot;)  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow&apos;s pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is &quot;powerful&quot; seems so weak a description.\n\nPart of the &quot;power&quot; of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital &quot;W&quot;.  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.\n\nStory is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;High and Low&quot; could be considered two movies.  The first, &quot;High&quot; takes place in Kingo Gondo&apos;s (Mifune&apos;s) hilltop mansion.  The crime occurs and what follows in the next hour is one of the most meticulous and brilliantly constructed film segments I have ever seen!  The first half of the film could almost be considered theatre.  It is static and deceptively simple but.....so intense!  The ensemble acting is superb with Mifune a stand out as usual!  Connecting these two movies is the train sequence.  After the calculated intensity of the first part this scene comes at you like a sledgehammer!  These four or five minutes are magnificent!  So very exciting and so very quick it leaves you drained when it ends!  &quot;Low&quot; begins with the hunt for the criminal.  Only &quot;Stray Dog&quot; comes closer to capturing the cop&apos;s decent into hell.  This last part of the film is fast and furious.  We are no longer an observer.  We have become part of the chase.  First, we know who the criminal is.  The police do not know and what follows is a fascinating puzzle being put together before our eyes!  The last scene in the film is unexpected, deeply disturbing and left me numb and staring at the TV screen after the film had ended.  Like Gondo we are left with the answers  that we did not want to hear.",

The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it&apos;s ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;Amadeus&quot;, while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart&apos;s genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer&apos;s play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, &quot;Amadeus&quot; is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  &quot;Amadeus&quot; is one such film."

            "reviewBody": "Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).\n\nKevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; &quot;a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused...&quot;. And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.\n\nLife starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.\n\nAs life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.\n\nThe writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms -  not  that you&apos;d be able to guess from the tone of this film).\n\nThe directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes&apos; theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.\n\nAnother person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.\n\nAll the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Braveheart - the definition of the word &apos;epic&apos;. Braveheart is a beautifully made film, with Gibson making a career performance. It follows a simple (almost clich\u00e9) revenge tale, but the cinematography, acting, music, and so much other elements make this movie great. While the film can get a bit slow at scenes, it makes up James Horner&apos;s amazing soundtrack, and for it&apos;s beautiful cinematography and atmosphere, it makes you feel like your right there. The slow scenes don&apos;t necessarily make the movie &apos;worse&apos;, but it makes you feel ingested in the screenplay. The movie is not historically accurate at all, and even though I&apos;m not really into the historical accuracy and everything....... it can get really annoying. Barely anything in this film is accurate, the only thing being William Wallace is Scottish. That&apos;s why I give this film 9 stars, not 10, being my only complaint. Rest of the film is superb.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t watched it, what the hell are you doing? Go watch it!",

            "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino&apos;s. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.\n\nWe know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn&apos;t been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin&apos; Nazi&apos;s. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He&apos;s know as the &quot;Jew Hunter&quot; and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.\n\nWar has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn&apos;t wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were M\u00e9lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.\n\nThe story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn&apos;t meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You&apos;ve really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.\n\nQuentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it&apos;s tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it&apos;s worth being checked out. It&apos;s time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."

The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.\n\nWhat &quot;Hunting&quot; essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn&apos;t aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers&apos; preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can&apos;t really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck &quot;paid their dues&quot; -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. \n\n&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck.",

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it&apos;s like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best &apos;steamed broccoli&apos; (ok, insert your favorite entr\u00e9e) I&apos;ve ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that&apos;s been me with &quot;Hamilton.&quot; For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn&apos;t all that. So, now I&apos;m here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.\n\nUnfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can&apos;t be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you&apos;ve seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what&apos;s happening is pretty clear. These aren&apos;t so much catchy sing-along types, but you&apos;ll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.\n\nOf course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow&apos;s book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it&apos;s Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from &quot;Mindhunter&quot;) is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I&apos;d like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the &quot;villain&quot;, but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it&apos;s never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it&apos;s most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... &quot;that would be enough.&quot;",

            "reviewBody": "One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov&apos;s stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia&apos;s triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov&apos;s shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.\n\nAt the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film&apos;s narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov&apos;s film owes something to Tarkovsky&apos;s use of the camera in Ivan&apos;s Childhood, although the context is entirely different.\n\nThe film&apos;s title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. &apos;Come and See&apos; is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander&apos;s arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.\n\nMain character Floyra is the director&apos;s witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to &apos;see&apos; - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha&apos;s reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.\n\nCome And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko&apos;s face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg&apos;s Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov&apos;s camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg&apos;s work concludes with a dramatic irony that&apos;s perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov&apos;s less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.\n\nHallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov&apos;s last film for, as he said afterwards &quot;I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,&quot; no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch.",

Besides, they ARE cute, and I don&apos;t care if they&apos;re marketable.  Yubb Nubb!\n\nThis movie always leaves me in tears.  It&apos;s perfect.  The end could not be better.  I&apos;m excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader&apos;s helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It&apos;s very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he&apos;s vulnerable.\n\nI don&apos;t know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?\n\nThe music is once again brilliant.  It&apos;s so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts &quot;NOOO!&quot; and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!\n\nAlready, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can&apos;t wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.\n\nBravo!",

The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it&apos;s characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it&apos;s movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."

            "reviewBody": "How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you&apos;ve seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you&apos;ve been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that&apos;s me.\n\nNotwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.\u0097creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish \u0096 just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to &quot;move&quot; me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan&apos;s room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That&apos;s for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don&apos;t watch this film if you&apos;re looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don&apos;t even skip this film thinking it&apos;s children&apos;s movie \u0096 no it isn&apos;t. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people&apos;s lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.\n\nOkay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it&apos;s two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They&apos;re there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.\n\nAamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That&apos;s the surprise but you don&apos;t miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;d say go and watch the film. I wouldn&apos;t recommend if you&apos;re addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.",

Certainly a very different movie not in the usual Hitchcock formula. The movie probably needs more than one viewing. I can understand why some people don&apos;t like it much, but if you can get into the mood and atmosphere it&apos;s a surreal masterpiece. The movie is really about creating a surreal dreamlike world to enter. Set in San Francisco in 1958 it is like nothing before or since. Unforgettable and mesmerizing it is full of great locations, strange characters and stories. We go on a strange uneasy journey with Jimmy Stewart where there is no return and end up somewhere between sanity and insanity. Everything about this movie goes together to create another world which you feel like you have entered, the music, the 1950s grainy film, the dull colours, the incredibly shot locations, the changing light. It is certainly a strange movie hard to put into a box. It is from another time. Amazing. Like a dream... A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood. A Hollywood which doesn&apos;t exist anymore. There is just something about this movie, which you can&apos;t put your finger on. It&apos;s full of secrets.",

            "reviewBody": "The first time I saw M, by Fritz Lang, I almost didn&apos;t know what to make of it. I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances, the staging of the scenes, the locations, and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again, and a third time, and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany- it&apos;s a powerful statement about protecting our children (if you&apos;re looking at it as a &quot;message&quot; movie), but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements, and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this, M is about a child Killer - the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role - who snatches children when their parents don&apos;t watch, and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld, they know something is up, that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be, so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.\n\nOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story, which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy. But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy, and indeed full-on artistry, of Lang&apos;s camera. He puts it in unusual places at times, and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene (this is, by the way, a precursor to &apos;film-noir&apos;, which Lang later became an important director in the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s). On top of this, there is a very modern sense of style in the editing- I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise. One is where the cops (I think it was the cops) have an argument about the investigation- two of them get into a shouting match, and we get medium close-ups of them going back and forth. This is done quickly, with a kind of intensity that isn&apos;t even captured in today&apos;s thrillers. There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house, where Lang cuts around constantly, heightening the tension between the predators (the criminals) and the prey (Lorre), until it&apos;s almost too much to take.\n\nThe disturbing aspects of the story, of child abduction and murder, have become benchmarks of a number of today&apos;s thrillers, where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows, in cat &amp; mouse style. This doesn&apos;t happen here, and because of it by the time we get to the final scene, with Lorre being interrogated and giving his &quot;I can&apos;t help it&quot; speech, it becomes something poetic, tragic, frightening. Lang doesn&apos;t leave his &quot;message&quot; so simplistically, he makes sure we know Lorre&apos;s side too, however twisted it has become, and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these present-day thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two. There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture, ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless, out of this comes a towering performance of a small, wild-eyed criminal in the midst of an extremely well-told and unpredictable mystery story. In short, if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re in for when you hear that whistle, those several infamous notes, you may not at all.",

So here it is: thanks to the writer, director, actors and all those who created this masterpiece. It really has the power to convey real feelings to the watcher. Even though I kept telling to myself it was just a movie, it still made me care for the characters.\n\nIt&apos;s a shame that such Films are not promoted as they should be. I am so sorry I had no idea about Danish cinematography until now. This movie will make stay alert for any new Danish production and look for older ones in a desperate try to recover what you could&apos;ve experienced instead of all the commercial movie offer of Hollywood.",

            "reviewBody": "The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane&apos;s life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud&apos; as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane&apos;s mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says `no trespassing&apos; that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane&apos;s life was the same way.  He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn&apos;t know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane&apos;s life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time."

A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.\n\nStir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain.&quot;\n\nThere&apos;s not a misstep in the movie&apos;s entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (&quot;She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!&quot;) and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (&quot;Fit as a Fiddle,&quot; &quot;Good Mornin&apos;&quot;).\n\nNot only that, but there&apos;s not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to &quot;You Were Meant for Me.&quot; Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.\n\nGreat stuff!\n\nIf you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven&apos;t seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won&apos;t regret it!\n\nPS: In the &quot;rent-this-too&quot; category, if you&apos;ve seen and love &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain,&quot; check out &quot;The Band Wagon.&quot; It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"

            "reviewBody": "I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn&apos;t believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.\n\nAs a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can&apos;t believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I&apos;ve watched this year, not even close.  I was totally amazed by her.\n\nAll in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven&apos;t been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will."

            "reviewBody": "My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock&apos;s direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people&apos;s heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",

With images throughout that will stay with you for a long time, and a terrific supporting performance by Miki Odagiri as a vivacious young &quot;office lady&quot;, &quot;Ikiru&quot; is still an absolute knockout more than 50 years on."

            "name": "Interior Landscape",
            "reviewBody": "Of all Kaufman&apos;s screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (&quot;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it&quot;); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.\n\nThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.\n\nThe manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry&apos;s visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.\n\nJim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.\n\nWhile there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you&apos;re ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film&apos;s conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been &quot;Warts And All.&quot;"

The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called &quot;The Bridge On The River Kwai&quot;.\n\nDavid Lean has shown us a man&apos;s long, yet never boring (at least for me) journey into the deserts of Arabia.  Lawrence (Peter O&apos;Toole) is an ordinary man that becomes a hero (at least in my eyes) during his extensive tenure in Arabia.  He becomes a traveler, a great man, and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.\n\nAn assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O&apos;Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence, Peter O&apos;Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O&apos;Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I&apos;m allowed only 1,000 words to use in my comment.\n\nWill all do respect to classics such as &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; and even &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;this is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.  I highly recommend it!",

            "reviewBody": "What makes a feature film different to a short? It isn&apos;t just length. After all, some of Charlie Chaplin&apos;s later shorts were as long as forty-five minutes, while The Kid is barely an hour. No, when Chaplin made his graduation to full-length features, he also strove to broaden the scope, scale and above all the dignity of his work. The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplin&apos;s career.\n\nThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory, as a few of Chaplin&apos;s shorts do, but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this. Here we have the opening of a drama, and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture, and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy. Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child. A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life, and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him, and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief. Of course, such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short, but here that wouldn&apos;t be appropriate. Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world, but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters \u2013 they are by no means laugh-out-loud funny, but they certainly don&apos;t belong in a straight dramatic setting. And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious, for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room scene.\n\nAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture. The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces. Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism, with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration, but still very natural by the standards of the time. And of course, little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive, his movements, expressions and timings all spot-on, so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness, and he appears more like a human cartoon character. Coogan steals the picture with ease, and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously aside.\n\nThis too is an important difference with The Kid. Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act, famously severing his partnership with the funny-in-his-own-right Ben Turpin back in 1915. Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags. Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own. The few examples, such as the routine with the policeman&apos;s wife and the window ledge, are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material. However, he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan, in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it, and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this out.\n\nToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful feature-length spin-off. If you look at something like the 80-minute Christmas special of The Office, it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements, and has become recognised as a masterpiece \u2013 better than the series. By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode. Chaplin&apos;s full length features however were far more than just spin-offs, and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work.",

The only detriment to this film is the fact that the first half (Boot Camp) is so much more powerful than the second half (Vietnam). \n\nThe film is basically about how war sucks the life out of humans and turns them into &apos;killing machines&apos;.  The greatest performances in this film are of course R. Lee Ermey, the savage drill instructor, and Vincent D&apos;Onofrio, his slow-witted whipping boy.  The viewer alternately laughs and cringes at the relentless abuse and degradation inflicted by the former on the latter.  And at the famous line, &quot;What is your major malfunction?&quot;, the tension reaches an almost unbearable limit and the viewer ceases to move or breathe.\n\nThis movie, like many of Kubrick&apos;s, is too graphic for many people, but I highly recommend it to those who can withstand its assault on both senses and consciences.",

            "reviewBody": "Jack Lemmon is the man.\n\nThe Apartment really surprised me. The Best Picture winner starts off right in the middle of the action, but yet the first hour seems long and overrun. Too much time seems spent in trying to develop the characters (and oh so many of them) and not enough time is spent on just seeing what will happen. Just when I was about to lose faith, the film picks it up like I have never seen before. The whole sub-plot of the four guys wanting to use Lemmon&apos;s apartment for their evening tyrsts is dropped and Wilder smartly concentrates on Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray and the film creates true magic.\n\nThe Apartment is more of a drama than a comedy and balances the two elements perfectly. Just after one of the more dramatic moments of the film, we see Lemmon straining his pasta with a tennis racquet. The use of the doctor and his wife in supporting roles are completely there for comedy and yet add so much to the film. The ending also rates up there with the best of all time using an old device that doesn&apos;t seem at all cliched in this film. Some say that &quot;Some like it hot&quot; was Wilder&apos;s best, but now I have to disagree. The Apartment is better and surely would have made my top ten had the first hour not been so predictable.\n\nHow Jack Lemmon didn&apos;t win Best Actor is beyond me. His is a great performance, getting to act on more than one scale. MacMurray, another Wilder favourite is perfectly cast in the role of a family-wrecker. I wish they would have put a scene in which his wife confronts him with &quot;The News&quot;. MacLaine glows on the screen even when she is sick and in bed.\n\nI fully recommend this film to all, it being Wilder&apos;s best makes it a must see.\n\n8/10 stars.",

            "reviewBody": "Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder&apos;s first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby&apos;s policy contains a clause that states that if the husband&apos;s death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator&apos;s boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .\n\nThis first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain&apos;s book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain&apos;s novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film&apos;s script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn&apos;t really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson&apos;s initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn&apos;t keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler&apos;s cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .\n\nExciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for \u00a8Body heat\u00a8 by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna .

            "reviewBody": "We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang&apos;s &apos;Metropolis&apos; are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upper-class and operated by slave-like poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film&apos;s ancestors &apos;Frankenstein&apos;, &apos;Batman&apos;, &apos;Gattaca&apos; and the cities of &apos;Blade Runner&apos;, &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;The Fifth Element&apos;. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang&apos;s work.\n\n&apos;Metropolis&apos; has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made, certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It&apos;s pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces (as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino&apos;s 1922 film &apos;Beyond the Rocks&apos;) the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It&apos;s the best version that I&apos;ve seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven&apos;t seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration, the film in grainy and difficult to see, it doesn&apos;t even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I&apos;m still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting (good), sound effects (not so good) and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy, Freddy Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Pat Benatar (yuck!).\n\nThose who study the film (myself included) find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but &apos;Metropolis&apos; has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it&apos;s hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film&apos;s chaotic nature. It takes place in the future (restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it&apos;s the year 2000 but I don&apos;t go by that) in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers (the Gothic, sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry). The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives, dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don&apos;t so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses&apos; slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn&apos;t ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.\n\nHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker&apos;s children. Curious, he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria, a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.\n\nFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang, the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film&apos;s most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.\n\nThen all Hell breaks loose, but the rest I must leave to you to discover.\n\nLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film (and therefore less successful), the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder, disguised as a worker, witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device, a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it&apos;s edge. The machine doesn&apos;t seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.\n\nThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism, astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria&apos;s erotic dance as the men gawk, the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.\n\nOther moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down, dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang&apos;s biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria&apos;s retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang&apos;s lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plague-bringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christ-like quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.\n\nThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang&apos;s insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster, working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20,000 extras (1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone) and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times, once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.\n\nI could go on and on, this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways, as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view &apos;Metropolis&apos; is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it&apos;s time, Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad."

The editing is pin sharp and beautifully cast with a superb musical track to keep you company. The framing, the photography, the pace all dovetail exquisitely and if you feel left outside of the game plan in your first viewing, never fear, the second time of watching, you&apos;ll enjoy it just as much but it will mean more. Certainly it&apos;s a film you&apos;ll want to see a second time. At least. Oscars rightly by the handful and nominations are full deserved to combine for a winning performance by all concerned. Definitely in my top fifty of all time."

            "reviewBody": "The release of Tarantino&apos;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino&apos;s success, but it wasn&apos;t until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn&apos;t a fluke.\n\nTurkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he&apos;s not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O&apos;Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren&apos;t confused yet, you soon will be.\n\n&quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, Mr. Madonna&apos;s (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel &quot;Snatch&quot; is stylistically very similar to &quot;Lock, Stock\u0085&quot;:  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;).  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.\n\n Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones&apos; manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad Pitt\n\nPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from &quot;Kalifornia&quot; and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend&apos;s Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O&apos;Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.\n\nWhile &quot;Snatch&quot; initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie&apos;s earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",

This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works.",

            "reviewBody": "Rating: ***1/2 out of ****\n\nWhat a fun film! From the moment it begins, &quot;Amelie&quot; bursts with joy and energy. It&apos;s a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn&apos;t matter how unbelievable some of it may be. &quot;Amelie&quot; is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn&apos;t very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.\n\n Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it&apos;s love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).\n\n I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It&apos;s not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn&apos;t very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.\n\nAfter seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can&apos;t possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.\n\n Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn&apos;t become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for &quot;Amelie&quot;. The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.\n\n With films like &quot;The Widow of Saint-Pierre&quot;, &quot;With a Friend Like Harry&quot; and box-office hit &quot;Brotherhood of the Wold&quot;, French cinema has had quite a year. It&apos;s a delight that we round off the year with &quot;Amelie&quot;, a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou&apos;s performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.",

Where else do we get to watch a man sit up with his ill child, stand firm in his convictions, show patience and gentleness with his children, demonstrate an appropriate level of humility, communicate righteous values to his children, and give his children a picture of integrity to emulate. Every time I view this film I wonder how Peck was able to pull this off. Every time I view this film, it gives me hope for the future of fatherhood."

            "reviewBody": "Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot; with the brilliant &quot;Per un Pugno di Dollari&quot; (&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone&apos;s westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. &quot;Per Qualche Dollaro in pi\u00f9&quot; (&quot;For a few dollars more&quot;), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.\n\n&quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, the second in the so-called &quot;Dollars trilogy&quot; (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named &quot;El Indio&quot; (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after &quot;Indio&quot; for the same reason? \n\nWritten by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film&apos;s main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the &quot;Trilogy&quot; and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.\n\nStylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone&apos;s previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone&apos;s realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre&apos;s conventions. &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.\n\nClint Eastwood&apos;s super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone&apos;s brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.\n\n&quot;Per qualche dollaro in pi\u00f9&quot; is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It&apos;s only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn&apos;t hurt the film. \n\nFans will always argue about which of the three films of the &quot;trilogy&quot; is the best, and while personally I prefer &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10",

            "reviewBody": "UP, Pixar&apos;s latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie&apos;s virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don&apos;t try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.\n\nThe one clue I can give away \u2013 because it&apos;s the movie&apos;s heavily hyped premise \u2013 is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.\n\nI&apos;ll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting \u2013 perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar&apos;s cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.\n\nAlso, part of the plot involves Carl&apos;s long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that&apos;s even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney&apos;s creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.\n\nBeyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There&apos;s a dog who&apos;s the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie&apos;s biggest laughs. There&apos;s a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that \u2013 at least in the audience I was in \u2013 when she&apos;s injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi&apos;s late mother.\n\nThere&apos;s surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that&apos;s practically a character in the movie \u2013 particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.\n\nThere aren&apos;t many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn&apos;t even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they&apos;ll get a product that will appeal to everyone.\n\nUP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action \u2013 nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle &quot;Bambi,&quot; this film should be a breeze.",

The film&apos;s success is not limited only to realistic depiction of human condition in early 20th century Bengal, but it brings up the triumph of human spirit, love and affection in spite of utter struggle in the most poignant way that one may think. Anybody remotely connected with movie making should also watch APARAJITO AND APUR SANSAR, to complete the experience, and off course to understand the art and craft of cinematic expression from the Maestro. No doubt it ranks in top 100 movie list from Time magazine, not to speak of almost all Indian publications connected with films rate this one as THE MOVIE.",

That&apos;s what I feel at the moment.\n\nI rate it as Mann&apos;s best. It&apos;s his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. \n\nWhat games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.\n\nWe all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn&apos;t work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.\n\nThis is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.\n\nA real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time.",

The complex story line seemed to burst at the seams with intelligence.  I found the complexity of several different sub-plots working together challenged the intellectual part of my brain while the intense action through out the entire movie satisfied the craving of the not-so-intellectual part of my brain that enjoys seeing a good brawl followed by a good shoot-out.  Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did and excellent job of combining many elements of several different kinds of films into one.  They seem to have made this movie with several different audiences in mind.  I for one, as I have mentioned, enjoyed the intellectual aspect as well as the action, while my wife enjoyed the combination of a love story with drama.  It really has something for everyone.  Bringing together all of these elements into one film sets it apart from many others. Of course the best aspect of L.A. Confidential is the way that not everything is as it seems, and then, in an instant, all of the plots are sprung like a trap and come together for a grand finale.  Overall L.A. Confidential is an exceptional film that contains something for everyone."

Over ten years Kurosawa was busy on this project and in 1985 it was finally there. Very well made, with beautiful costumes, music and cinematography, a great direction and some good performances. Although I think Kurosawa has done better (&apos;Rashomon&apos;, &apos;Ikiru&apos;, &apos;Yojimbo&apos; and of course &apos;Shichinin no Samurai&apos;) &apos;Ran&apos; definitely belongs to his best.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not going to waste time debating which was the &quot;greatest&quot; or &quot;best&quot; of Kurosawa&apos;s movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it&apos;s &apos;Yojimbo&apos;. &apos;Rashomon&apos; and &apos;Throne Of Blood&apos; are probably deeper and more substantial, but for sheer entertainment value &apos;Yojimbo&apos; is hard to beat! Being a Kurosawa movie it&apos;s no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. The two made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watch the most. I love looking at Mifune&apos;s face! His expressions are awesome. He was without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars. &apos;Yojimbo&apos; was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically &apos;A Fistful Of Dollars&apos;, but before you bay for Sergio Leone&apos;s blood, please read Dashiell Hammett&apos;s detective classic &apos;Red Harvest&apos;, published in 1929 and you&apos;ll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it.  I see no mention whatsoever of this source material in the credits for &apos;Yojimbo&apos;, so let&apos;s just leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincingly argued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westerns anyway. Walter Hill later &quot;remade&quot; &apos;Yojimbo&apos; (or &apos;Red Harvest&apos; depending on your perspective) as &apos;Last Man Standing&apos; and David Lynch gave a small nod to it in his &apos;Wild At Heart&apos;.  You can certainly see both the samurai and spaghetti influences in Tarantino&apos;s &apos;Kill Bill&apos; 1 and 2, that&apos;s for sure. &quot;Influences&quot;, &quot;inspirations&quot;, these are things that go around and around, it&apos;s what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. &apos;Yojimbo&apos; is a classic action movie. Maybe only &apos;Wages Of Fear&apos; is better. Every film buff needs this movie in their collection!"

            "reviewBody": "&apos;People forget the unpleasant things.  They only remember what they want to remember.&apos;\n\nIn Rashomon the editing tells \u00bd of the story.  It may feel experimental or unconventional, but Kurosawa perfects the concept second by second, directing and editing.  This film didn&apos;t need a big budget to come perfectly to the point.  It&apos;s a simple tale, but not a superficial tale.  Different points of view and selective memories (&apos;It&apos;s true! I saw it!&apos;) don&apos;t only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. &apos;We humans are weak creatures. That&apos;s why we lie, even to ourselves&apos; says it all actually: it&apos;s about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking.  Selfish excuses vs trust in other people.\n\nRashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.  That is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal, or try to copy when they fail.  Admitted &apos;Memento&apos; (2000, Nolan) is a truly great one.  Still not THAT universal.  &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos; (1994) didn&apos;t come close,  &apos;La Commare Secca&apos; (1962) also didn&apos;t.  &apos;Ghost dog: the way of the samurai&apos; (1999) touched another border of the concept, or does it?\n\nThe use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence, not only in Rashomon, but also in Kurosawa&apos;s forthcoming films, and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.\n\nThe cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on.  The shadows of leaves and branches, captured by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, make you really feel &apos;in the woods&apos;, while the actors (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, Takashi Shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers).  It may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film.  After weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it&apos;s only 85 min), and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that Kurosawa made. 10/10"

In fact, I will dare say that the biggest crime surrounding this film is that Ganz was not lauded with every single acting award available. Never before has such dimensionality and care been applied to a performance of, quite possibly, the most vile human who ever lived (with the exception, perhaps, of his cohort Himmler). It&apos;s a confusing, sharp yet tender mix of sorrow, pity, anger, and ultimately, frustration. \n\nInitially, I figured this would be a very low budget chamber piece. But it is as epic in scope as a Spielberg war film, with effects to match. A real surprise. But don&apos;t be fooled by eye candy. Der Untergang is a human story. It is an amazing built film. And it is unreal. A must-see."

First off, Better Davis was always an incredible actress, no matter what part she took and this was the perfect part for her. Anne Baxter is tremendous in the part of Eve - she plays the part well. It&apos;s multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She&apos;s got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show &quot;Promised Land.&quot; But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake. I can see why he won the Oscar. I don&apos;t want to say much about the story. The film is one that has to be taken in as a whole to be truly appreciated. Enjoy it - it&apos;s as tasty as honey! One thing - please never let them make a re-make of this film - it&apos;s perfect. It&apos;s off limits. It would be painting a new version of the Mona Lisa. This one is perfect!"

            "reviewBody": "Monty Python will always be loved or hated depending on your personality. And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.\n\nThe jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (&quot;I am Roger the Shrubber&quot;) to more subtle and intelligent jokes (&quot;I thought we were an autonomous collective&quot; / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there&apos;s something for everyone. No one is left out.\n\nWhat many don&apos;t realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don&apos;t understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn&apos;t have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (&quot;Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!&quot;). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience&apos;s vocabulary.\n\nAnd for those who can&apos;t keep up with historical jokes, there&apos;s the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.\n\nSo if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It&apos;s worth the effort, and you&apos;ll learn a little about history too."

He directed this film in a very clever way, by using one camera for the majority of the scenes, he could easily edit the film together without studio interference.\n\nThe script is well written. The dialogue between Lemmon and Curtis is beautifully balanced.\n\nMonroe is just too hot for the screen in this picture. Although, Monroe had major off-screen problems (83 takes to get things right) she is fantastic on-screen. She may not have the best lines, but what the heck! She plays the role very well.\n\nOverall, this is awesome, it really is."

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan&apos;s previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won&apos;t give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. \n\nWhat&apos;s impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what&apos;s up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nOf the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. \n\nMost refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director&apos;s cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn&apos;t return after this, there&apos;s no justice.",

            "reviewBody": "There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn&apos;t anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.\n\nKevin Costner tries hard but he just doesn&apos;t get it. Dances With Wolves wasn&apos;t really a western. It wasn&apos;t even an anti-western. It was more like a political indictment of the actions of the Americans of the time. For all that I did enjoy it.\n\nMost of the others since Unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse, but the story is just generic pap. Nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.\n\nI will grant that Deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn&apos;t a movie.\n\nThat&apos;s why I believe that Unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. I won&apos;t get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how Clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. Cuz that&apos;s a load of crap. The script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. What it is, is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. There are only shades of grey.\n\nIt is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. Life was comparatively cheap and most people didn&apos;t have much hope of justice. The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.\n\nGood guys didn&apos;t wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. Some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. Little Bill mocks English Bob&apos;s self-promotion, but at the same time he knocks Bob down he builds himself up. He doesn&apos;t bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. He isn&apos;t motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. It&apos;s more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.\n\nWilliam Munny is a killer, plain and simple. He has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. He changed for his wife, but like many changes it wasn&apos;t permanent. He won&apos;t sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.\n\nRather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud.",

            "reviewBody": "When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl&apos;s Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.\n\nI&apos;d never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels \u0096 a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience&apos;s intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.\n\nI saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones&apos; Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan \u0096 much was changed, but the soul is the same.\n\nFor those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I&apos;ve tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones&apos;s work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book:\n\n\u0095 Why the witch bespells Sophie\n\n\u0095 Where the door opens when the dial points to black\n\n\u0095Sophie&apos;s sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie \u0095 Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie \u0095 Michael (Markl) is a different age \u0095 The battles \u0096 magical and military \u0096 are quite different (but equally spectacular) \u0095 The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda \u0095 The scarecrow&apos;s relationship with Sophie is different \u0095 Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)\n\nMy advice: go see the movie. It&apos;s magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki&apos;s films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones&apos; books. (There is a sequel to Howl&apos;s Moving Castle \u0096 Castle in the Air.)\n\nAnd enjoy!",

            "reviewBody": "Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.\n\nShowy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; is the equivalent of something like &quot;Good Fellas&quot; or even more so &quot;Casino&quot; but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone&apos;s &quot;Wall Street&quot;.\n\nWhere Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.\n\nLeonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.\n\nIt&apos;s a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.\n\nOne could almost hear Scorsese&apos;s clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.\n\nIt is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."

            "reviewBody": "I once read a review of this film that criticized the fact that the American chief prosecutor as played by Richard Widmark was a less sympathetic and engaging character than the defending lawyer, Herr Rolfe as portrayed by Max Schell. Schell&apos;s Oscar winning performance illuminated the &quot;shattering truth&quot; that the film reveals about Nazism. Extremely able and educated men were able to rationalize what they did with an irresistible logic. They loved their country and, in a time of a national crisis, found it necessary to implement certain measures. As expounded by Rolfe, it all sounds so logical and reasonable. He also cites the fact that many world leaders actually commended Hitler upon his leadership in getting Germany out of the Depression as swiftly as he did.\n\nWidmark&apos;s character, Lawson, is understandably appalled by Herr Rolfe&apos;s defence of the indefencible and therefore he pulls no punches. He wants those responsible to be held fully responsible but he finds Germans who are ready to extenuate and rationalize. After he is told to tone down his demands for justice, Lawson acerbically retorts, &quot;There are no Nazis in Germany. It was those damned Eskimos.&quot; \n\nThe moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when Pohl, a right hand man for Eichman, explains how it was possible to kill millions of people in purely technical terms. His explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid of any hint of human empathy for the victims he has so blithely exterminated. His was a job that was the logical extension of a policy and he carried it out with a detached and technical logic.\n\nThe key point that the film makes is that to be logical is not always to be morally right."

            "reviewBody": "There Will Be Blood (2007) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nAmbitious film about an oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis) who will stop at nothing to find the black gold. I must be honest and say I don&apos;t know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson&apos;s camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis&apos; rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn&apos;t a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn&apos;t call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese&apos;s Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that&apos;s certainly not a slam against his performance here because he&apos;s great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he&apos;s doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis."

            "reviewBody": "Casino is a very good film. If you&apos;re at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you&apos;re at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I&apos;m a huge De Niro fan, and I&apos;m a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.\n\nBut I don&apos;t think that Casino is at all a &quot;perfect&quot; film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you&apos;re familiar with my reviews, you&apos;ll know that it&apos;s not that high of a score from me--it&apos;s closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I&apos;m going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10&apos;s.\n\nCasino is based on the story of Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein &quot;secretly&quot; runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It&apos;s roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.\n\nThe film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi&apos;s book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It&apos;s remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.\n\nOne of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.\n\nEventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese&apos;s directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.\n\nThis is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That&apos;s a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.\n\nAnother unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I&apos;ve owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded &quot;mix tape&quot; mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin&apos; tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.\n\nPresumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that&apos;s what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein&apos;s suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.\n\nThat Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I&apos;m not sure the final result exactly worked.\n\nOf course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that&apos;s how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it&apos;s a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we&apos;re shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.\n\nBut the slight flaws shouldn&apos;t stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.",

            "reviewBody": "Although John Huston&apos;s directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes &quot;Treasure of The Sierra Madre&quot; the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston&apos;s award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter&apos;s portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.\n\nWhen, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood&apos;s most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do.",

The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself! \n\nThe violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!\n\nGive it a go if you can get to a screening, DON&apos;T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!",

            "reviewBody": "The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show &quot;Monk&quot; has become.\n\nCrowe&apos;s character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as &quot;Monk,&quot; but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don&apos;t take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain&apos;t so. (One example: in real life, Nash&apos;s wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)\n\nThe first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn&apos;t have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I&apos;m not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005&apos;s &quot;Cinderella Man.&quot;\n\nFor those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven&apos;t seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash&apos;s actions from the beginning.",

Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale&apos;s are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",

Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker&apos;s jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I&apos;d love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray&apos;s father, Noah Cross.\n\nAs a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn&apos;t and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other &quot;classics&quot; of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.\n\nNeedless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I&apos;ve seen \u0096 not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role.\n\nOverall this is a very classy film that has stood up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great, with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script."

There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I&apos;m convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can&apos;t see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.",

One reviewer did criticize him for hanging around the dark side a bit much, but that could be said about Nicholson and a host of others. This is one of those mind puzzles that force one to guess a good deal. Because of the pace, I eventually figured it out. Nevertheless, it is told in a very interesting way. With &quot;Inception&quot; capturing the box office recently, this seems a mild effort to explore the subconscious. It is multi-layered and complex. It throws curves and red herrings, but I never felt toyed with. This is certainly worth a shot.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with &quot;Hatchet&quot; Harry, the local gangster.\n\nUnfortunately, Harry&apos;s game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.\n\nThe final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.\n\nThe acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slow-motion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.\n\nWhile this film may not be for everyone, if you enjoy a darker pallette, this may be right up your alley."

            "reviewBody": "While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.\n\nTo some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. &quot;No Country For Old Men&quot; is really his story. He doesn&apos;t know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it&apos;s something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.\n\nThe film&apos;s premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there&apos;s lots of silence.\n\nOverall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh&apos;s requests in a characteristic Texas twang.\n\nThe film&apos;s color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It&apos;s a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.\n\n&quot;No Country For Old Men&quot; is a fine film. I&apos;d describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.",

            "reviewBody": "A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot; is Hitchcock&apos;s second &quot;drawing-room perfect murder&quot; movie, after &quot;Rope&quot;, the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious &quot;Rear Window&quot; which immediately followed it in his career.\n\nHowever. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.\n\nYes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn&apos;t grown out of by &quot;Marnie&quot; some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it&apos;s well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.\n\nRay Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who&apos;d want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it&apos;s pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (since &quot;Saboteur&quot; in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.\n\nAbout those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly&apos;s doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can&apos;t imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann&apos;s jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland&apos;s unexpected approach.\n\nYes, it&apos;s old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it&apos;s old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.",

The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it&apos;s not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.",

This is the one where he eats a boot, along with its laces, and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rolls.\n\nThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin, Lita Grey, but her pregnancy ruled her out. Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions. Mack Swain appears as Big Jim, who shares a cabin with the Tramp, at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and gold-runners, as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero. As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time, as a sound film, it is fairly good.",

            "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; on the promise of one of the year&apos;s best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh&apos;s previous work. \n\nOn the most part &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film&apos;s many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. \n\nDid have a couple of issues with &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. \n\nEpileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). \n\nAbbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn&apos;t have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. \n\nThere are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon&apos;s actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.\n\nHowever, there is so much to like about &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos;. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn&apos;t in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand&apos;s performance is a career high and one of the year&apos;s best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don&apos;t condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother&apos;s worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film&apos;s most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage&apos;s, although Dinklage doesn&apos;t have the film&apos;s most tragic scene). \n\nSam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it&apos;s the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. \n\nAnother standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not &quot;likeable&quot; ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). \n\nA large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It&apos;s the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. \n\nWith the exception of one scene, &apos;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&apos; is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell&apos;s music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous &quot;Last Rose of Summer&quot; exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. \n\nOverall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year&apos;s best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The story is based on the true account of John Merrick&apos;s life as a side show freak in the nineteenth century. The viewer is taken on a journey of a man trying to regain some self-respect and the doctor who is helping him to do so.\n\nIf you are like me and in a bad space in your life, watch this movie. Although a depressing film there are brief moments of hope with the interaction of Merrick and Treves. But, mostly it is scene after scene of abuse, torture and the dark side of human nature. This is not a movie that a viewer is going to want to watch time and time again. Watching this movie is like being drug through a crime scene, most don&apos;t want to look but most can&apos;t help themselves. After viewing the film, I felt a lot better about my life, and right now I am unemployed, fat and alone.\n\nThat being said, the movie taken as a work of art was excellent. The black and white cinematography really added to the Victorian feel of the nineteenth century. The character development was superb and the acting of Hopkins and Hurt phenomenal. The makeup and costuming was dark as the film itself and the direction by Lynch, using his signature &apos;dream&apos; scenes only added to the dimness of the entire film. I highly recommend this film once because it is beautifully directed and a great story. But, unless you are a masochist, once is enough."

            "reviewBody": "This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.\n\nI didn&apos;t see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn&apos;t find it as &quot;the greatest movie ever&quot; as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I&apos;ve come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I&apos;ve seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn&apos;t find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I&apos;m talking about. For those who haven&apos;t, I&apos;m not going to spoil it here.\n\nI enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he&apos;s low key, as he is in here (and in &quot;Unbreakable,&quot; to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it&apos;s nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.\n\nOsment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He&apos;s simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I&apos;ve seen in many years.\n\nThis isn&apos;t just some supernatural-horror movie. It&apos;s a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment&apos;s mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.",

If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"

            "reviewBody": "A wonderful film. It showcases the natural beauty of the Taiga and presents a contrast between the technological and the pastoral. Dersu is one with the forest. He knows its ways and its moods. The Russians scoff at his ways and his &apos;primitive&apos; belief system, but eventually come to rely on him, and even love him. It is a beautiful story that takes place in an world that very few of us in the West have had a chance to see. I thought the fact that the film was set in the pre-revolutionary period gave it a peculiar sort of charm - Russia before the Great War and the Russian Revolution was innocent and even naive, the same way the Russian soldiers were innocent of the wonders and the dangers of the Taiga. One of the things I loved most about this film was the cinematography - there are long, lingering shots of the landscape, the endless steppe, the forest, the rivers, the mountains. We believe ourselves to be powerful because we have been moderately successful in our attempts to harness nature for our own uses, but the film shows us that we are deluding ourselves, that nature cannot be controlled or resisted, and the truly powerful are those, like Dersu, who co-exist in harmony with nature and learn what the wilderness teaches.",

            "reviewBody": "In Ingmar Berman&apos;s film masterpiece Smultronstallet (or \u0091Wild Strawberries&apos; B&amp;W, 1957), the protagonist, an elderly professor who is facing death, has to come to face to face with a long life that has failed to answer the important questions. He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.\n\nBergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life&apos;s most important question \u0096 that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn&apos;t exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It&apos;s a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss \u0096 the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.\n\nIn one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene \u0096 only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures \u0091loss&apos; on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.\n\nThe imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman&apos;s own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black \u0096 ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman&apos;s existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man \u0096 as futile as Sisyphus&apos; labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor&apos;s first duty is to ask for forgiveness.&apos;). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.&apos;).\n\nIzak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.\n\nThe film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic \u0096 a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?&apos; `Don&apos;t ask me.&apos; I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film&apos;s important question."

Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) is Harry&apos;s girlfriend. Harry&apos;s friends Baron Kurtz and Popescu describe the accident but Holly is told by another that there was a third man.\n\nThe best part of this movie is director Carol Reed. His camera work is amazing. The best scene for me is the balloon man. When he walks around the corner, it is the funniest and most shocking moment in the movie. Orson Welles is so tied into this movie but I don&apos;t find him threatening enough. He&apos;s more of a trickster. I would like Harry Lime to be scarier. Also Anna is an infuriating character. Overall, the story is fine. Joseph Cotten is great. The movie is a cinematic art work.",

            "reviewBody": "This is probably the best crime thriller I&apos;ve seen since &quot;Insomnia,&quot; and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since &quot;Seven.&quot; But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.\n\nThe filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.\n\nFirst, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.\n\nSecond, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980&apos;s, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea&apos;s first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.\n\nFinally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul&apos;s insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective&apos;s scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.\n\nOne flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.",

            "reviewBody": "Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick&apos;s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to &quot;retire&quot; four genetically engineered syborgues, known as &quot;Replicants&quot;.  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director&apos;s cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.\n\nRidley Scott&apos;s hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we&apos;ve seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.\n\nThere is a hint of style from the 40&apos;s, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael&apos;s entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40&apos;s.\n\nThe soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.\n\nThe special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.\n\nThe script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director&apos;s Cut).  Rutger Hauer&apos;s performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah&apos;s chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.\n\nThere is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn&apos;t my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success."

            "reviewBody": "This film became almost a cultural phenomenon as soon as it was released in Britain in February 1996.\n\nAdapted from the first (and best) book by Irvine Welsh, the film shows the lives of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts.\n\nThe film is a black comedy, at times hilarious, tragic, surreal, brutal and uplifting.  The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh&apos;s Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the &quot;Worst Toilet in Scotland&quot; headfirst.\n\nThe film doesn&apos;t condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.  \n\nThe film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.  Especially memorable is Robert Carlyle as the violent Begbie.\n\nI have seen this film many times.  It is an instant classic.  Go check it out."

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet&apos;s, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter &quot;What&apos;s this?&quot; in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the &apos;90s.",

            "reviewBody": "First off, what is so amazing about this film is that, for the time that it was made, how modern it looks. David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white.\n\n   William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not.\n\n   Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British&apos;s own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil. \n\n   And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago.",

            "reviewBody": "I know it&apos;s a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven&apos;t seen one of my favorite and refreshing I&apos;ve seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino&apos;s short, but distinguished list.\n\nKill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.\n\nThe movie is really a combination of Tarantino&apos;s love for the 70&apos;s over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale&apos;s blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.\n\nThere are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino&apos;s continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you&apos;re not a fan of Tarantino&apos;s films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn&apos;t stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don&apos;t like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don&apos;t blame you but it&apos;s still worth your while seeing.",

            "reviewBody": "Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King&apos; and `Beauty and the Beast&apos;) were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents&apos; chagrin). Now, animated movies aren&apos;t exactly the `coolest&apos; things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo&apos;.\n\nAfter losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child&apos; remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.\n\nAlong the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend&apos;, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.\n\nThis is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet&apos;, which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking&apos; fish instead of 1960s animated fish).\n\nMy favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres&apos; fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.\n\nCompared to `Monsters Inc.&apos;, `Finding Nemo&apos; is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters&apos; was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character. Director Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job at making the film work and be (basically) non-annoying to most of the general public (and this critic).\n\nI suppose life has come full circle-now that I am (relatively) old as a high school graduate, animation is cool again, thanks to high-powered computers, at any rate. `Finding Nemo&apos; is one heckuva movie and a good one to take anyone you know to, trust me on this-nine out of ten.",

And yes, it may be, to some, &quot;just another fight movie. However, Warrior has the audacity to challenge the clich\u00e9&apos;s and still manages to stand out from the rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Go see this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret not supporting what is sure to be a classic!"

No matter what language you speak, what culture or country you hail from, this element is universal.\n\nIt&apos;s pretty much perfect... every character is fleshed out, there are no plot holes left open...

            "reviewBody": "This compelling and dynamic drama is set on New York&apos;s dock where mobsters control the Union and stevedores . An ex-prize fighter named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando who deservedly won an Academy Award) turned longshoreman struggles to stand up to his corrupt union bosses (Lee J Cobb) and is embroiled in violence . Malloy faces the dilemma of whether or not to turn informer . While his brother (it was originally offered to Lawrence Tierney , but he asked for too much money so the role went to Rod Steiger who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance) is a crooked lawyer and he meets a beautiful ex-nun (Eva Maria Saint , Grace Kelly turned down the role of Edie Doyle, deciding to make Rear Window instead) and falls in love for her .\n\nThis interesting and thought-provoking film contains intense drama with pungent lines , emotion , wonderful performances , memorable final , magnificent direction and classic musical score by the maestro Leonard Berstein . Marvelous acting by entire casting . The taxicab scene , one of the most famous scenes in the cinema, in which Brando began to improvise some dialogue, surprising Rod Steiger ; after a while, Elia Kazan told Brando to &quot;knock it off&quot;. The problem Brando had with the scene, as he explained to screenwriter Budd Schulberg and Kazan, was that he felt he would have difficulty trying to talk reasonably with his brother with a gun at his ribs , at this, Kazan agreed and told Brando to improvise ,Kazan maintained that he did not direct Brando nor Steiger in this scene, he simply stood back and let the two actors direct themselves. The idea for the film began with an expose series written for The New York Sun by reporter Malcolm Johnson , the articles won him a Pulitzer Prize and were reinforced by the 1948 murder of a New York dock hiring boss which woke America to the killings, graft and extortion that were endemic on the New York waterfront. Budd Schulberg was captivated by the subject matter, devoting years of his life to absorbing everything he could about the milieu. He became a regular fixture on the waterfront, hanging out in West Side Manhattan and Long Island bars, interviewing longshore-union leaders and getting to know the outspoken priests in Hell&apos;s Kitchen. The leading characters were based on real people: Terry Malloy was based on longshoreman and whistle-blower Anthony De Vincenzo; Father Barry was based on waterfront priest John M. Corridan; Johnny Friendly was based on mobster Albert Anastasia. On the Waterfront is widely known to be an act of expiation on the part of Elia Kazan for naming names to HUAC during the Joseph McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s. What is less widely reported is that Kazan intended it as a direct attack at his former close friend Arthur Miller who had been openly critical of Kazan&apos;s actions. Specifically, it was a direct response to Miller&apos;s play The Crucible.\n\nThis trend-setting film has a gritty portrait of N.Y. waterfront and stand up well nowadays and resulted to be a huge financial hit , as from a budget of just under $1 million, the film went on to gross ten times its production costs in its initial release. Film debuts of Michael V. Gazzo, Pat Hingle, Martin Balsam, and Eva Marie Saint. The last gave a debut performance that won her the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. It&apos;s a winner all the way , winning eight Academy Award , including : Best Picture , Direction (Kazan) , Cinematography (Boris Kaufman) , Art Director (Richard Day) . Rating : Very good , above average , and a real must see . Well worth watching .",

As a person who has been experienced those years, the film became a very big sentimental burden for me. Those were the tough days for many. It is a very touchy story..\n\nHowever, it is not that what makes this film good one.. You don&apos;t need to know all Turkish history to feel the movie.. You don&apos;t need to be Turkish either.. This is emotion.. This is life.. The Mediterrenean way of life.. I guess in a Mediterrenean perspective the movie would appeal to many. I myself watched a lot of Italian movies with similar scenario. The life from a 7-8 yo kid&apos;s eyes gather things in a three-generational dimension.... There are many scenes that are going to be remembered long.. The first encountering of the kid and grandfather is really touchy.. The blood is thicker than water.. This is what so called about a FAMILY..\n\nBy the way\u0085 for the international audience.. Deniz is name of Turkey&apos;s one of the most famous leftish youth leaders in 70:s with a great charismatic personality. So, that&apos;s why the name of the kid is not at all a coincidence..",

            "reviewBody": "Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family&apos;s two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven&apos;t gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he&apos;s willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. \n\nA spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn&apos;t feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There&apos;s one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters&apos; actions and the characters themselves, and there&apos;s the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can&apos;t possibly (always) be the &quot;goody-two-shoes&quot; heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie&apos;s events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. \n\nAnd holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there&apos;s Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. \n\nSpeaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you&apos;ve left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that&apos;s transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year&apos;s Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. \n\nFurthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you&apos;re of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and &quot;fun,&quot; such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year&apos;s features that I&apos;ll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let&apos;s hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. Do you often get accused of having a slightly demented sense of humor? Do you have secret crazy thoughts of seeking revenge on those who have wronged you? If so, writer/director Damian Szifron has a collection of short stories just for you!\n\nNominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar, Argentina&apos;s entry is just now opening in the Dallas market where I live. To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn&apos;t take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.\n\nThe best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it&apos;s fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.\n\nNot to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable &quot;coincidence&quot; on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with &quot;the system&quot;, misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.\n\nIf you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity. The seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback, though the price is often pretty high. Mr. Szifron&apos;s stories remind us that life is not fair, but when it&apos;s happening to someone else, we can still laugh about it.",

            "reviewBody": "Stalker (1979)***\u00bd Stalker is rich, spiritual and contemplative journey through the fantastic inner world of human&apos;s hope, desire, disillusions and believes. Main characters, Writer (as incarnation of irrational, imaginative and emotional aspects of our nature or subconsciousness) and Scientist (rational, logic forces or consciousness) are guided by Stalker (symbolizing our desire, will and everlasting search of meaning) to the mysterious Zone (which may represent all our spiritual goals, meanings, struggles to achieve them and barriers in our path). Breathtaking and mesmerizing images and sounds, witty dialog and strong concept are the major virtues of this feature. Writer&apos;s monologues are among the most meaningful, thought-provoking and spiritual moments I ever experienced in any art. But the movie is overlong losing its powerful initial momentum and becoming inconsistent in it&apos;s final message (by final I don&apos;t mean last in chronology but overall). Tarkovsky&apos;s earlier SF drama &quot;Solaris&quot; is more structured and fully developed. Nevertheless, Stalker is an outstanding piece of art movie that puts its director among the few true cinema masters. Rating: 8.5/10",

Through humor and deep emotions, this film shows us that people are complicated and life is unpredictable.\n\nSuch films are rare, and nowadays they are almost non-existent. The development of the main character and the depiction of his emotions and internal conflict are interesting, which is exactly the basis of the film. There is also a bit of humor in the film, located exactly where it should be and thus creates that necessary balance against the cruel reality.\n\nThe script is brilliant, and Clint Eastwood turned it into a great film, managing to evoke tension and feelings, as well as the inner struggle of the characters. The film is superbly directed and easily guides the viewer through the story. The cinematography is excellent, as is the photography. The soundtrack fits perfectly into the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThis is an old-fashioned drama with interesting characters that are not one-dimensional but complicated and layered. Unfortunately, the actor who plays the character of Thao is simply not a good actor, but the rest of the cast played their parts excellently. I was particularly impressed by Ahney Her in the role of Sue, and Clint Eastwood is equally excellent in the role of Walt Kowalski. Also, Christopher Carley excellently portrayed the character of Father Janovich, a young and somewhat naive priest, whose character is also interesting and develops throughout the film.\n\nA great, powerful and inspiring film.",

            "reviewBody": "One of the great masterpieces of cinema, Buster Keaton&apos;s &quot;The General&quot; combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama, all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed.  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching.  As an extra bonus, it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era, with many realistic details, inspired by a historical incident.\n\nAfter a short opening sequence, the movie divides nicely into two halves. Johnny (Keaton) is a railway engineer, turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl.  Continuing with the railroad, one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies, who also kidnap his girl.  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it, and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home.  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun, with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in.  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touches.\n\nKeaton is at his best, with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents.  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein, and his character&apos;s stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic action.\n\nThis belongs near the top of any list of great films, a classic worth watching and re-watching."

            "reviewBody": "Ingmar Bergman&apos;s &apos;Persona (1966)&apos; opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I&apos;d hit a wrong button and started playing Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s &apos;Un chien andalou (1929)&apos; by mistake. I question Bergman&apos;s motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth&apos;s continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I&apos;ll admit that the strength of &apos;The Seventh Seal (1957)&apos; arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman&apos;s face. Elisabeth&apos;s unloved child? Alma&apos;s aborted fetus?\n\nAn endless line of critics, it seems, have celebrated &apos;Persona&apos; as a masterpiece, and among the greatest films ever made. I&apos;d hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but the film is certainly the lesser of the three Bergmans I&apos;ve hitherto seen, if only due to the noticeable absence of the good-natured humour to be found in both &apos;The Seventh Seal (1957)&apos; and &apos;Wild Strawberries (1957)&apos;. If, indeed, I were to describe &apos;Persona&apos; as a masterpiece, it would be in regards to the visuals, which, photographed by long-time Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist, are beyond description in their detail and intimacy. The film takes particular interest in the human face, and entire conversations of words and emotions are played out through the communication of the eyes, and the glimmering hint of a smile on the lips. There is one immortal moment in the film when Bergman juxtaposes the faces of each woman onto the screen, merging Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) and Alma (Bibi Andersson) into a single entity.\n\nPersona also includes one of the most vivid depictions of sex that I&apos;ve ever seen. Though the film shows us nothing, Alma&apos;s whispered description of an intimate encounter on the beach is staggering in its effectiveness; her words allow the viewer to formulate their own visuals, every emotion and nuance perfectly incorporated from the rich story we are being told. Though I may exhaust hours spouting the merits of Ingmar Bergman&apos;s film, I can&apos;t escape the fact that watching &apos;Persona&apos; felt very much like a chore. The film boasts a relatively short running time, but it never seems to attain any comfortable sense of rhythm, and, by the film&apos;s end, I was left wondering just what the film was trying to get at. Bergman includes various allusions to Bertolt Brecht&apos;s &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; effect \u0096 highlighting the inherent artificiality of the cinematic medium \u0096 with the film at one point appearing to burn; but, unlike in Fellini&apos;s &apos;8\u00bd (1963),&apos; these self-referential flourishes seem to serve little foreseeable purpose. Am I looking too far into this film for meaning? Or am I not looking far enough? Even just hours afterwards, another layer of meaning has unfurled itself. Maybe it&apos;ll get better.",

            "reviewBody": "This Keaton classic is both funny and extremely clever in its construction. Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.\n\nThe first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster&apos;s father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son&apos;s films.\n\nThere&apos;s a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.\n\nIt is in Junior&apos;s other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.\n\nSherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.\n\nJustly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton&apos;s cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.\n\nThe script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.\n\nThe dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is &quot;love&quot; in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.\n\nThis is simply a gem of a movie that you can&apos;t miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!",

He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.\n\nBased on a true story, although it doesn&apos;t rely on `and it really happened&apos; to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.\n\nThe presentation is good.  Williams&apos; score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn&apos;t fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn&apos;t set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.\n\nThe cast is good even if they aren&apos;t all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I&apos;ll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I&apos;m not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.\n\nOverall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it&apos;s own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!"

            "reviewBody": "Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It&apos;s just beautiful.\n\nFor that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It&apos;s no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you&apos;ll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.\n\nNot to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say &quot;underrated&quot; because this film, from what I&apos;ve read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That&apos;s too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, &quot;Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,&quot; played beautifully by Ryan O&apos;Neal. (For most of the movie, he&apos;s called &quot;Redmond Barry,&quot; so I will refer to him as that.) \n\nOverall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a &quot;scoundrel&quot; back in late 18th century Englishman. &quot;Mr. Barry&quot; is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he&apos;s not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don&apos;t always know how he&apos;s going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.\n\nWe witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his &quot;sins begin to find him out,&quot; as the Bible would describe. It&apos;s quite a roller coaster ride.\n\nThis is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It&apos;s quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day. Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.",

            "reviewBody": "James Stewart and Frank Capra.  One needn&apos;t know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na\u00efve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children&apos;s camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor&apos;s political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.\n\nThis film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra&apos;s films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  \n\nI was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren&apos;t realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. \n\nStewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don&apos;t compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.\n\nJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith&apos;s noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.\n\nThis film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.  A 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "What a clever film this was. Quite modest yet remarkably entertaining. Instead of blaring political bias, viewers are treated to a compassionate human drama without the preachings and irritating banter of most other &quot;social dramas&quot; (Dog Day Afternoon, All the President&apos;s Men, Norma Rae). It&apos;s shameful that this film didn&apos;t receive at least two academy awards, despite it having been nominated for 7. Now considering that this was the same year that Schindler&apos;s List and The Piano, two outstanding dramas, were released, it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat In the Name of the Father for many of the awards.\n\nThe acting in this film is terrific. Lewis is low key and quite effective as the petty Irish thief Gerry Conlon. Pete Postlethwaite is spectacular as Gerry&apos;s father Guiseppe (certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was in the fugitive). Emma Thompson&apos;s portrayal of attorney Gareth Pierce received much acclaim, and properly so. Beatie Edney, who had a small part as a wrongfully accused British teenage hippie, was so enamoring that its a wonder we don&apos;t see more of her.\n\nOf course much of this film is exagerrated and perhaps fabricated for the purposes of entertainment (as all movies which are &quot;based on a true story&quot; tend to be) but it&apos;s so finely done that it doesn&apos;t seem to matter. Some terrific scenes include the beginning, when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers, the trial in London, the prison scenes (which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies), and of course the powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven&apos;t, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes."

Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield&apos;s eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!",

As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers.

            "name": "Awesome film - shame about the trailer",
            "reviewBody": "Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack&apos;s 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within &apos;Room&apos; - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in &apos;TV land&apos; and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? \n\nAnd that&apos;s where I&apos;ll leave this synopsis, since (if you&apos;ve been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.\n\nThis is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny &quot;Frank&quot; Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the &apos;evil kidnapper&apos;, is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.\n\nThe film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that &quot;Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives&quot;.\n\nThe acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn&apos;t great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won&apos;t give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year&apos;s weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.\n\nSupporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy&apos;s mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the &quot;Bourne&quot; films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.\n\nAt 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true &apos;teaser trailer&apos; this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and &apos;given a good talking to&apos; for this travesty. It&apos;s like putting all of the twists in films like &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Gone Girl&quot; in their respective trailers. I&apos;ve gone so far as to create my own One Mann&apos;s Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.\n\nA leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of &quot;Die Hard&quot; or &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.\n\nPlease visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.",

Costas Gavras did his best to present the prevailing atmosphere and the political situation in Greece ( although Greece is at no point straightly mentioned, but implied ) during May of the year 1963, which is the year when the real events took place. Choosing an adventurous, thrilling or hilarious style according to the facts and scenes presenting at each part of the story, he made an &apos;&apos; all time interesting and provocative &apos;&apos; film. Great acting was also put in by everybody and particularly by Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was great as the Examining Magistrate. As long as the script is concerned, the plot builds up very satisfactorily and carefully, thus not leaving any holes. Great respect should also be paid to Mikis Theodorakis who wrote the original score for the movie, helping it gain the marvelous rythm it retained right until the very end of it. As a concluding remark I would like to mention that anybody who&apos;s interested in late Greek history ( from post World War II era to date ) should watch it carefully. The whole result is very rewarding.",

Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan&apos;s inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan&apos;s conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality."

            "reviewBody": "12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nWho can possibly argue against the power of this kind of movie, and the injustice that it waves as a welcome reminder? Superbly directed and acted (especially leading man Chiwetel Ejofor playing Solomon Northup), and set with high levels of realism in pre-Civil War America, there is little to separate what the filmmakers intended and what they achieved. A work of excellence.\n\nIt is not, however, quite the masterpiece it might have been. I don&apos;t mean the story or the level of competence here at all. I mean the way the story is told, the choice to simply tell it like it was.\n\nThat means that the presentation is quite linear (excepting a few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like a last minute editing decision). And uncomplicated. This is the biggest surprise. I mean, the basics might seem enough\u2014a free black man in Saratoga goes to Washington and is kidnapped and made a slave, and he remains a slave until his recovery 12 years later. But that is actually the entire movie.\n\nOh, I know, the details are missing in that sentence. But it is these details where the movie succeeds too well. We are shown the horrors of slavery and made to experience them. It isn&apos;t that this is ignoble or unimportant. On the contrary, this is an &quot;important&quot; film and should be seen. But in some weirdly surreal way, we already know everything that happens in these details. \n\nDo we need to see a woman, naked and tied to a post, whipped and whipped and whipped, with screaming in our ears? Many will say yes. We need to feel that horror even a little bit (through a movie) to understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was. I would just argue back that I don&apos;t really want to be tortured directly to confirm what I already fully agree with. It&apos;s just a choice you want to make as a moviegoer. It&apos;s similar to watching a kidnapping movie\u2014do you want to experience the inner and outer torments of the kidnapped, or see some larger view of a kidnapping situation and the complexities of that kind of plot?\n\nFor me, then the movie was excellent at being literal, but that&apos;s not enough. For example, there is absolutely no hint at what the family did when Solomon didn&apos;t return home after his trip to Washington. Did they search? Worry? How? Who helped, who ignored them? Etc. That&apos;s just one of many complexities the movie avoids for the sake of a direct experience of the protagonist. \n\nI hope that gives a sense of where this unpleasant, terrific movie leaves you, and whether to watch it.",

That&apos;s why it&apos;s also very touching. The outcome of the craziness was unknown at the time. That also makes this film daring. Whether intentionally or not, the film implies that Hitler himself was a Hitler-impersonator, that Hitler is a kind of unattainable ideal, a Platonic idea of pure evil. A similarly sublime and bold and touching film made during another craziness (not twenty years thereafter, as its more applauded cousins!) is &quot;THE GAY DECEIVERS&quot; (1969). It too dances with the gods, and breaks your heart as it makes you laugh."

You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller&apos;s Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.\n\nChanneling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (&quot;The Dude&quot; to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude&apos;s bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He&apos;d much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).\n\nAs with so much of the Coens&apos; output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?\n\nThis is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven&apos;t already.",

            "reviewBody": "There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.\n\nDead Poets Society is one of those few films.\n\nI saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our &quot;homework&quot; for the day. We didn&apos;t need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn&apos;t watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.\n\nBack when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that&apos;s it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to &quot;seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary&quot; (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.\n\nThe fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.\n\nSo here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don&apos;t think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.\n\n10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.",

I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn&apos;t feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don&apos;t want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!\n\nBRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.\n\nGo see this movie!"

The costumes were also incredible. The actors portrayed the best purest form of both ancient Roman and old Judean culture. This film also had quite an emotional effect. The way that Christ&apos;s face is never visible nor his voice audible to the audience creates a feeling of reverence to the actual person of Jesus. Lew Wallace also did an amazing job portraying the innocence, kindness, and mercy of Jesus, and his effect on the main character, Judah Ben Hur. Hur&apos;s ending quote, &quot;I felt him take the sword out of my hand&quot; was a wonderful picture of his changing. I admit, I am a Christian, but even for those who are not this is still a great film. The message boards confirm that. I recognize that there are some people that require constant action to keep their attention. If this is your case, than this movie is not for you, as it has a lot of dialogue. But I recommend this movie 100%."

What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it&apos;s about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year.\n\nIt&apos;s nice to see beautiful animation movies challenging Pixar&apos;s, it definitely benefits the viewer the most. How to train your dragon - Highly Recommended.",

            "reviewBody": "I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80&apos;s action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.\n\nI&apos;ve also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There&apos;s no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It&apos;s not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron&apos;s character. I didn&apos;t think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn&apos;t terrible. He just didn&apos;t lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.\n\nSpecial mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.\n\nGo see this movie if you like Mad Max!",

            "reviewBody": "Clint Eastwood always explores the darker side of human nature and the duality of man. His dark hero of Unforgiven, William Munny, tries to repent only to be thrust back into that violent world he knows so well. His regretful Frank Horrigan of In The Line Of Fire and his womanizing Steve Everett of True Crime also want redemption.\n\nEastwood&apos;s Frankie Dunn of Million Dollar Baby is the most conflicted, weathered, and vulnerable he&apos;s ever played. When he weeps in a darkened church it&apos;s like watching a house of cards begin to fall. This is a man whose had a regretful past and can&apos;t run away from the curve balls life has thrown at him. Frankie Dunn is like most of us where we eventually get punished for our good deeds.\n\nThe funny thing is that Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie despite the way it&apos;s being advertised like a female version of Rocky. Yes, Hilary Swank&apos;s Maggie trains to be a boxer under the guidance of Clint Eastwood&apos;s Frankie Dunn. Yes, Morgan Freeman is Scrap, Frankie&apos;s tough friend and ex boxer. Yes, the bulk of it takes place in a boxing gym. Yes, there are numerous boxing matches. Despite all this it&apos;s still not a boxing movie.\n\nWhen you see it you&apos;ll be surprised by the utter humanity in the piece. This film runs very deep and you will care for the three main characters. Eastwood gives us something we rarely get in films today. He gives us real people.\n\nThe film is about the triumph of the human spirit, the emotional world we try to hide from that eventually sucks us all in, our compassionate hearts, and the difficult decisions we face when it comes to those we care about. It&apos;s about friendship, trust, and the bonds of the heart that are unavoidable. It is a true masterpiece.\n\nHilary Swank is all fire and guts as Maggie. Her intensity and commitment has guided her to another Academy Award. She knows she&apos;s poor, she accepts it, and she pushes forward despite her limitations. This is not to say she can&apos;t be hurt. We watch her eyes well up a few times and truly feel her pain despite the fact that she is as tough as they come. Morgan Freeman, who finally won a long overdue and well deserved Oscar, plays Scrap with the perfect combination of toughness and compassion. He knows the situation from every angle and his narration of the film rings true.\n\nSee this film. It deserves it&apos;s accolades because it&apos;s about real characters and it&apos;s directed with honesty, warmth, and true pain. Clint Eastwood gets better with age and his films reflect the days of real movie making. The sets are simple, the characters are complex, and the story moves in a pace closer to real life than any other director could reach. Eastwood has been called the Hemingway of Film making. You don&apos;t get more real than that. It was great seeing this natural storyteller take home his second Oscar for Best Director and Picture."

            "reviewBody": "Ingmar Bergman claimed, in the DVD-introduction, that Ingrid Bergman told him that she wanted to make a film with him. The result was, and still is, a cinematographic masterpiece that compromises neither with style or emotion to get the message out. Ingrid Bergman is simply astonishing in the role as the world famous singer that after years of neglecting her children returns to find her oldest daughter full of hatred towards her. A hatred she doesn&apos;t understand, somewhere inside being a child needing attention herself. The tension between mother and daughter is building up, at first it is jolly but soon we see cracks in the surface of both Ingrid Bergman&apos;s glamorous Charlotte and Liv Ullman&apos;s quiet and suppressed Eva.\n\n&quot;H\u00f6stsonaten&quot; is beautiful, but it takes its toll on the viewer. If you aren&apos;t prepared for it, it can be an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves you chocked when its over. The beauty and the ugliness of the human soul, ripped apart by anger, disease and sadness, is clear in this work of art.",

Cluozot&apos;s own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because &quot;if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them&quot;. Henri-Georges Clouzot&apos;s view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot&apos;s ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory.",

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix&apos;s acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. &apos;Stand By Me&apos; is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it&apos;s style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it&apos;s message and it&apos;s wonderful acting.",

            "reviewBody": "Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.\n\nI&apos;m actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn&apos;t particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he&apos;s such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I&apos;ve read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook&apos;s portrayal of him. Honestly, I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ve had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I&apos;m excited to watch Boyd&apos;s show &quot;Narcos&quot; now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can&apos;t stress that enough. \n\nI want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it&apos;s amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it&apos;s amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It&apos;s truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I&apos;m almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we&apos;re used to, and that&apos;s another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don&apos;t really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That&apos;s an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they&apos;re not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the &quot;normal&quot; people being killed off by the government, and I really don&apos;t think that&apos;s the message that was needed right now. However, &quot;Logan&quot; is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can&apos;t even consider giving it a lower than perfect score. \n\nI&apos;m excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It&apos;s definitely up there with the likes of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. However, this movie can stand alone as something more than &quot;just a superhero film&quot;, and as I&apos;ve heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It&apos;s time for a little change in the genre. While I can&apos;t say I&apos;m particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I&apos;m more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is &quot;Logan&quot;."

Manoj Pandey has delivered an outstanding performance. The movie has to be rated &quot;A&quot; because of a lot of abuses (which implies, its not a family flick). But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn&apos;t disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra &amp; Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood&apos;s Quentin Tarantino. A must watch.",

            "reviewBody": "I first saw this film in 1997, after seeing and reading reviews about it on tv and the net for a couple of years. I never thought a film could actually make you truly think about things around our world, not just how bad it can be in places like the projects set in the film. I could truly see this happening where I am from(Rochdale,Manchester,UK).\n\nThe situation set in the film is a dark and nasty one. you watch 3 friends fall apart from the aftermath of a riot in a parisian project.a friend is near-fatally injured in police custody, which sparks a chain of events, part forced onto the 3 friends, part of self-inflicted.\n\nthe acting is amazing. Vincent Cassel&apos;s performance is electrifying. his mentality is distorted with hate(hence the film name), but you truly feel he is not a bad seed. His problem is he can&apos;t see the wood for the trees, which Hubert tries to point out to him.\n\nHubert is a character who has the potential to better his life, but he is trapped in his parisian project cell. he tries to guide vinz to a healthier and more productive way of thinking about life.\n\nsaid seems to be the one who doesn&apos;t want trouble, but it is thrust upon him. he sees the relationship between hubert and vinz, his 2 best friend, deteriorate, but doesn&apos;t know who to side with, or what to do about it.\n\nMathieu Kassovitz made this film in a way that you feel for both the police and the the 3 friends. It is amazing to watch, as mathieu takes the simplest things, and makes them look classy(check out the DJ scene for a true example of what I mean). he uses black and white as to colour, and it doesn&apos;t look fake, or cheesy. in fact it enhances the film more than you could imagine. you won&apos;t sit there and wish he filmed it in colour by the end. the action, although relatively mild compared to todays film, is believable.\n\nspeaking about the end, it is one of the most simplest and powerful endings I have seen in a film yet. the soundtrack is awesome too. who would have thought french hip-hop would sound so sweet.",

            "reviewBody": "A Silent Voice or Shape of Voice is a beautiful drama film about a guy who struggles to redeem his past that tackles heavy themes such as bullying.\n\nApparently, there are a lot of characters in this 2-hour long film. And quite a number of them I believe didn&apos;t develop to the maximum as the film concludes but it was suffice enough to convey the message that the film desires to.\n\nHowever, huge compliments should be given to this film for the amazing build up before reaching its climax which is realistically intense, powerful and heartfelt that will leave you on the edge of your seat with your jaws dropped. You might as well cry, too.\n\nThe only technical thing that I didn&apos;t like in this film is that some scenes have unusual tones that don&apos;t match well with their focuses (most probably because of cultural differences). It was really odd for me.\n\nIn a nutshell, I love this film for tackling heavy themes and also for its healthy dose of drama. I believe it might be better if it&apos;s made into a series. XD\n\nThank you for your time!",

I&apos;ve never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.\n\nI read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can&apos;t remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn&apos;t only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is &apos;God&apos; in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it&apos;s true.\n\nIt&apos;s a must watch movie.",

            "reviewBody": "I first saw &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. &quot;Luke&quot; is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson&apos;s screenplay is nothing less than a working man&apos;s parable of a truly good soul who just couldn&apos;t seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn&apos;t let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn&apos;t knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I&apos;ve clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall&apos;s cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. &quot;Dragline&quot;. The most unforgettable &quot;gentle giant&quot; I believe I&apos;ve ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman&apos;s masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can&apos;t speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn&apos;t worth his getting worked up over. Wasn&apos;t gonna get to his spirit.",

            "reviewBody": "Every day life, however &apos;real&apos; and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950&apos;s. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the &apos;here and now&apos;. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950&apos;s \u0096 films that explored the filmmaker&apos;s surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut&apos;s &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nAfter viewing Truffaut&apos;s &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;, I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. \n\nNothing is cut and dry in &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a &apos;so what&apos; feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel&apos;s life \u0096 anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;, it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut&apos;s cinematography in &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like &apos;An American in Paris&apos;. This is Paris from a Parisian&apos;s perspective \u0096 and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian \u0096 the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.\n\nThere is still a lot that I have to learn and think about &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with &apos;The Four Hundred Blows&apos;.\n\n--Shel",

            "reviewBody": "The Vietnam War has been one of the controversial wars in history and was an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. Oliver Stone harnessed these experiences to make Platoon; a film where he could illustrate to everyone what Vietnam was like from his perspective.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best war movie ever made. The sheer horror of war is captured so well in everyway. The fear of death, compatriots dying, divisions in the platoon, guilt of killing; it&apos;s all there and Stone doesn&apos;t try to disguise it. Platoon is very honestly written and it is this honesty that makes the film so great. Platoon isn&apos;t an anti war movie and it certainly does not glorify war in anyway, it is simply how war is in its entirety. There are some shocking scenes such as the one in the Vietnamese village but there are also more light hearted moments such as where the troops on Dafoe&apos;s side are partying and having a good time. On base camp, there is great contrast with the mood but on the forest, it is just fear, aggression and blood, nothing else.\n\nTaylor&apos;s (Charlie Sheen) story is very good as he experiencing war at the same time of the audience. Before the war, he was a rich kid who loved his grandma and it is how war changes him that is truly fascinating. The character story that always receives most praise however is that between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe) is very compelling and leads to some great scenes with them and carves an interesting divide within the camp. This film is big on character and explores many relationships but (take note Jarhead) doesn&apos;t sacrifice any action time for these scenes. Stone struck a perfect balance between action and story.\n\nActing from everyone involved is very good. Sheen as the na\u00efve newcomer is very good and after this, should have done much better for himself than he did. Dafoe and Berenger, once again steal the attention off the lead. Their extreme contrasting personalities is brilliantly done and raises the standard of the film. Berenger is truly terrifying, he didn&apos;t hold back in this one. Dafoe is much more sympathetic and will speak his mind to anyone. Johnny Depp makes one of his early film appearances with a small, yet memorable role. The way Sheen is wearing Depp&apos;s bandana after Lerner (Depp) gets taken by the chopper is discretely done but touching.\n\nPlatoon is the best war movie there&apos;s ever been. Stone wrote and directed this film with such passion that it couldn&apos;t be anything but good. A great mix of characters, a great cast and such well crafted action scenes are all what you need for an exceptional war movie and they&apos;re all here. The film ends perfectly as we are given a chance to reflect and take it in before the credits start rolling. Stone, who often misses the point with his films, hit the nail on the head with this one.",

John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There&apos;s no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.\n\nAnd the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don&apos;t get why ABC couldn&apos;t give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning."

            "reviewBody": "I spent the majority of this film thinking about how lucky M. Olivier really was. To be able to wrap his arms around Joan Fontaine and kiss her. Oh my. She&apos;s one of the most beautiful women I&apos;ve ever seen (almost, but not quite as beautiful as Veronica Lake). She&apos;s also absolutely perfect in the role of the second Mrs. DeWinter, taking a character that could have become a cloying bore in less capable hands and transforming her into a sympathetic and interesting figure.\n\nThe movie, on the whole, is similarly amazing, capturing the spirit and the tone of those great Gothic romances. Watching Rebecca, I was reminded (pleasantly) of Wuthering Heights; I do not mean to suggest that in some way this film re-tells the tale of Cathy and Heathcliff, but rather that Rebecca has the feel of Bronte&apos;s novel (I am most certainly not talking about the William Wyler adaptation a few years before the release of Rebecca. That&apos;s a terrible film that somehow manages to mis-interpret the novel).\n\nI must assume that the guiding hand of Hitchcock played no small role in recreating the feel of a Gothic romance. There are very few that would be able to take a love story, infuse it with such gloom, with such a sense of foreboding, and still manage to create something that ends happily without it feeling like a cop-out. I&apos;d also like to draw everyone&apos;s attention to the incredibly moving section of the film that occurs between the arrival of the second Mrs. DeWinter at Mandalay and the masqued ball. The emotional strain on the Joan Fontaine character is so palpable, so absolutely taxing, that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her. Few other movies affect me so emotionally - one of them is Vertigo.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic piece of film-making from Hollywood&apos;s golden age. Laurence Olivier is in top-form, as he plays the quiet, sad Maxim and George Sanders is positively hateful.\n\n10/10 - a visceral masterpiece"

            "reviewBody": "And in the 1979th year of Our Lord, God took in a screening of Monty Python&apos;s &quot;Life Of Brian,&quot; and thought it was funny. \n\nHe did NOT think the film was blasphemous or offensive in any way. Yea, God did admire it&apos;s incredibly clever pokes at religion and at religious fanatics, for God Himself knew the virtue of being able to laugh at one&apos;s self. He also knew before He even walked into the theater that the title character, Brian, was NOT Jesus Christ, but merely a man who was born at the same time as Christ---right next door, in fact---and became mistaken for a messiah. God settled into His seat, with popcorn in one hand and diet soda in another, and had a rollicking good time.\n\nHe recommended &quot;Life Of Brian&quot; to His Son, Jesus, who went to see it the following week. He, too, thought it was a hilarious film, and immediately sang the praises of the Monty Python troupe---John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam &amp; Michael Palin---for creating such a wonderful spoof. And He recommended the film to His friends. Have an open mind, He told them, and have fun. \n\nBut God and His Son were quite puzzled why so many people in the Bible Belt community were so upset by &quot;Life Of Brian&quot;---especially the ones who hadn&apos;t even bothered to SEE the frigging film for fear of being damned for all time. And They both shook their heads in dismay. It&apos;s only a movie, They thought, and a very funny, harmless one at that. Get a life!\n\nBut God gave Monty Python&apos;s &quot;Life Of Brian&quot; the power to overcome such ridiculous adversity, and today, well over two decades later, the film is rightfully regarded as a comedy classic, and one of the Python&apos;s finest works. It&apos;s *still* not a film for everybody, but does it have to be? If you&apos;re in tune with the Python&apos;s style of zany comedy, you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;Life Of Brian.&quot;\n\nAnd praise be to Saint George Harrison, late of The Beatles, for lending the Pythons a hand in making this wonderful movie. :-)",

Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. &apos;In the Mood for Love&apos; is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Amor \u00c0 Flor da Pele&apos; (&apos;Love on the Surface of the Skin&apos;)",

In my review, I&apos;ll try to stay away of spoilers but I&apos;ll also give you a good treatment of the plot as well (just the big-picture).\n\nMovie starts as Baran, an old eskiya (a honorable bandit) is getting out of prison after 35 years of jail to find his village and his home under the waters of Firat river. He then learns that his confinement was due to an old comrade&apos;s betrayal, and that his comrade took away and married his lover, Keje. Baran comes to the biggest city of Turkey, Istanbul to seek his old comrade and maybe to take revenge...\n\nDue to an unlikely coincidence, he meets Cumali, a young man that has no family and is living in Istanbul, earning his life with criminal acts. Baran the Eskiya is not familiar with the city-life but Cumali is willing to help him because of his debt.\n\nBaran the eskiya has a deep character, despite his criminal past, he looks like a naive person in the metropolitan city of Istanbul. Despite that he is an uneducated person, he may be the most honorable and wise person in this big city. Sener Sen (Baran) and Ugur Yucel (Cumali) each gives spectacular acting performance and their talents combined with an intelligent script breathe life into this &quot;Eskiya&quot; myth. Baran is the last of the Eskiyas !\n\nThe movie has a slow start but towards the ending, the mood gets stronger. The movie reaches it&apos;s climax at the dramatic scenes to the finish. This is a story about honor and the power of love. This is a story about two strangers that are becoming tied emotionally, like the father and the son. A classic Turkish Action/Drama movie for all to see ! \n\nPS. also check out another Turkish movie &quot;Kabadayi&quot; by the same director/writer (Yavuz Turgul) and the same actor (Sener Sen).",

CAN&apos;T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! \n\nThe Director and the story&apos;s protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes. Near the end of the q&amp;a, an older man stood up and was called on. Slowly he commented that as a Tutsi, the movie gave him a lot to think about and that it may now be possible to find peace in his heart. The audience was stunned. And believe me, it takes a lot to silence a San Francisco audience. \n\nOne last comment, the film is indpendently made and distributed - no Hollywood involvement at all (Terry George is British). There will be no machine pumping out ads and radio anouncements about this one. Help get the word out - great film!",

            "reviewBody": "I never thought I would ever watch a Ron Howard movie again much less write a good review of one.\n\nHoward hasn&apos;t made a movie since &quot;Parenthood&quot; that has not bored me to tears and almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal to take any risks. He&apos;s turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg&apos;s technical panache.\n\nHowever, the great reviews of &quot;Rush&quot; and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It&apos;s a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don&apos;t need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don&apos;t) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don&apos;t expect it to push any boundaries, but it&apos;s much more technically daring than anything else he&apos;s made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver&apos;s seat more than once.\n\nGrade: A-",

Others simply won&apos;t watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot;). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, &quot;Amores Perros&quot; is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.",

            "reviewBody": "Brilliant, captivating, and sometimes just plain awesome are some of things that come to mind while watching yet another one of Miyazaki&apos;s epic tales: Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds. Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it&apos;s action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.\n\nWithout revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.\n\nMiyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl&apos;s Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.\n\nIt amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it&apos;s depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn&apos;t find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.\n\nCombining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it&apos;s age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80&apos;s, Miyazaki&apos;s production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, &amp; animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.\n\nKeep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It&apos;s cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version &apos;Warriors of the Wind&apos;, which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.\n\n9 out of 10",

Lalettan&apos;s acting was spectacular. actually every actors did their job fantastically even the kids. its a beautiful scripted movie by Jeethu Joseph.oh god i really loved this movie. while watching most of other Malayalam thrillers,some time we get bored. and in the case of this movie we wont take our eyes from the screen. trust me you wont regret about money you spend on ticket. the movie contains a lot of suspense. the climax really shocked me. i was clapping with standing in the theater.as i mentioned above every actors have acted way beyond their level. i must say something about Kalabhavan Shajon. i didn&apos;t know he has such talent in acting.he really shocked me with his negative character. Asha Sarath,actually i didn&apos;t like her that she acted in TV Serials, but i became a fan of her.she acted very brilliantly in Dhrishyam. I&apos;m not getting into the story, i don&apos;t want to ruin the suspense.\n\nyou can watch it with the family.",

Jesse and Celine reunite after nine years. Things haven&apos;t turned out the way they had expected but here&apos;s a chance. &apos;Before Sunset&apos; follows pretty much the same style as &apos;Before Sunrise&apos;. This one too is very much a conversational piece. Here the score is used to a minimal. During the end we hear some songs including Julie Delpy&apos;s beautiful &apos;My Waltz&apos;. The cinematography consists of more long shots than in the first movie. The film has a very mature feel to it. Of course Jesse and Celine are a lot more mature today and less idealistic than they were nine years ago. Linklater beautifully captures the love between these two characters as he walks us through the streets of Paris. Here too the dialogues are just as magical as in the first movie except that this time there&apos;s a melancholy about the things that could have been, the years that they could have been together. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are terrific as ever and they deserve additional praise for the writing and Ms. Delpy for her singing. Overall, &apos;Before Sunset&apos; has everything that made &apos;Before Sunrise&apos; a phenomenal movie experience."

            "reviewBody": "I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels. First, it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor, best actress and best director.  So it should be seen just for it&apos;s historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form. However, if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The  set up is that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled,  independent woman who is running away from her father (in Florida) to  join her husband (not quite a complete marriage) in New York City. She  meets Peter (Clark Gable) on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed -know it all reporter - Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the 30&apos;s about the 30&apos;s. This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy. However, his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times (the know it all guy). The  character comes across as too simplistic by today&apos;s standards. However,  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  &apos;white trash&apos; was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and  is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however, hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable (their first scene together) the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience."

            "reviewBody": "Some historical knowledge will definitely not hurt while watching this film.\n\nThe medieval society was deeply religious. The church influenced every aspect of people&apos;s lives from birth to death and was part of the state. It means religious leaders were as important as rulers.\n\nIn Russian society men were wearing beards and women covered hairs. Remove a beard from a man or uncover woman&apos;s hair and you will humiliate them, they would feel like modern people being undressed in public.\n\nPaganism is a form of religion, where people believe in many gods instead of one. The main Russian pagan gods are the goddess of the earth and the god of the sun. Among others - the god of storms and lightning, the mythical young women living in forests and rivers. Despite many centuries of suppression of paganism by authorities some in modern Russia still celebrate the feast of Ivan Kupala (which could be translated as Ivan Gathering) depicted in the movie.\n\nAlso I have to mention, that Soviet censors told Tarkovski the movie is too cruel. They told him the scene with a burning cow, for example, is absolutely unacceptable. Tarkovski tried to defend the movie. The cow wasn&apos;t harmed, was his reasoning. Still the film was cut. The censors knew better what is good and what is not for the viewer.\n\nThis brings us to what is the message of Tarkovski in this film. There are many messages actually. I&apos;ll be telling only about one here, because it is not hidden. It is there, in the dispute between Rublov and Theophanes The Greek. They both are talented, both want to bring people to humanity. Theophanes is tired, he says - common people live in darkness, they are completely consumed by sin and the only way to make them humans is to scare them and punish them. Rublov advocates for love. He says: people live very difficult life, it&apos;s amazing how they endure it. We have to love them, to remind them, they are humans, they are Russians. You see, the first is the position of the Soviet system, the second - of Jesus Christ.\n\nMe? I&apos;m still sitting on the fence. :)\n\nI recommend to watch this movie many times. You will do it without my recommendation though, if you (like me) will not understand everything from the first view and you like to think. The mesmerizing beauty of this movie will help you to return easier. For the first time be prepared for not a cakewalk. There are two things to consider here. One is the cruelty. Though it is absolutely necessary in this film, most of us living in a comfort of modern society are not ready to it. The other is the pace. Often it is a pace of real life. \n\nPeace.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot; How Disgusting&quot; the last line of the movie may be in the minds of must viewers who see this film. This being an alternate ending to the post modern epic TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion. But although many viewers will probably leave either the theaters or their living room confused and dumbfounded this film is a great alternate conclusion to the TV series. The thing that makes this movie perfect is the fact that although one may not understand the details and significant plot points in the movie one can just marvel at the art direction and stunningly beautiful backgrounds present throughout the film. I myself am confused on some points of the film and the series but that does not harden my outlook on this film. Many hardcore fans have the luxury of understanding the plot and connecting the significance of each character to one another. I am glad that Anno gave us an ending that most fans agree is better than the TV ending. I think this film is a treat for all viewers and is one of the best anime movies i have ever seen. Even if one has not seen the anime TV series before, one can just marvel at the spectacular visuals displayed throughout the film and more importantly knowing the plot of the film is just a treat that adds to the films perfection. Overall even though this film leaves us a lot of questions the opportunity to find those answers makes this film and this film experience a reward for film watchers everywhere.\n\nDirection: 10/10 Art: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Writing: 10/10 Overall: 10/10",

Fellini&apos;s &quot;Le Notti di Cabiria&quot; is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. It grows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved in different ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta Masina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments on its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament that this gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will help remedy the movie-going public&apos;s oversight. The film&apos;s rich concluding scene alone (and Masina&apos;s glance into our eyes) remains one of the most magical moments ever projected on a screen.",

Then all of a sudden, this amazingly haunting music starts, and we&apos;re told the story in flashback of how the Algierian people tried to revolt against the French Soldiers.\n\nFrom what I understand, the movie uses no documentary footage, which is amazing as some of the scenes in the movie must have taken a great deal of effort to produce., There are some pretty amazing crowd scenes and the explosion scenes are just breathtaking.\n\nAlso, I guess some of the actual revolutionaries are in the film as well. They are pretty hard to point out as  all of the acting here is amazing, very realistic.\n\nSo, looking for a war movie? Dammit, don&apos;t go for Private Ryan, go to Algiers.",
